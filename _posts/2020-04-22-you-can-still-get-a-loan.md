<center>You may have heard that loan guidelines have become stricter. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about getting one.</center>

&nbsp;

I hope this message finds you safe, healthy, and doing well. You may have heard that some **lenders are tightening their loan qualifying guidelines.** This could mean they’re now requiring a higher credit score, higher down payment, more savings, or a combination of these. Banks want to ensure they’re providing loans to borrowers who are not considered high risk.&nbsp;

If you are pre-approved right now, double-check with your lender to ensure that pre-approval is still valid. If you’re considering buying a home this year, contact us so we can refer you to one of our preferred lenders who are still providing many options for loans and actively lending money. If you’re ready to buy, we encourage you to start the process immediately, before more potential lending changes arise. Buyers are still getting into gorgeous houses with very low interest rates and small down payments.&nbsp;

If you’re considering selling your property, don’t delay\! Make sure your home is on the market soon, since we currently have extremely low inventory, and buyers still have the power to purchase because of excellent financing options. While many buyers are in the market and lending is good, chances are better that your house will be sold at a fantastic price. So **if buying or selling is in your near future, now is certainly the time to act\!&nbsp;**

Call us at (330) 681-6090 or email us today for a free, no-obligation pre-approval and free home valuation, and let us guide you safely and successfully through the current market. Also, please contact us if you have any questions about real estate in general. We would love to help you.&nbsp;
