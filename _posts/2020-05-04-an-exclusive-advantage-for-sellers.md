<center>We offer our Coming Soon program to sellers, which helps promote your home.</center>

&nbsp;

We hope everyone is well and continuing to stay safe and healthy. **Today’s message is for homeowners:** We have a wonderful advantage for you here at the Amy Wengerd Group. We can help you achieve the highest sale price for your home in the shortest amount of time. It’s called our Coming Soon program, and it helps you promote your house to buyers.

Most people need to work on their property before we send our photographer to the house. You may need to clean carpets, take down wallpaper, declutter, paint, etc. However, these things can take time that you don’t want to lose. Put us to work for you\! We want to get the word out about your property to all potential buyers so they know your home will be on the market soon.

We offer our Coming Soon program to all home sellers. We place a sign in your yard advertising your house as “Coming Soon,” **and we promote it in our MLS to all local real estate agents and their clients,** we expose your property to our database of over 14,000 clients, we talk to our team of seven exclusive buyer’s agents extensively about your home so they can match it to one of their current buyers. We also market your house to our social media followers— almost 3,000 people—and we advertise it on our exclusive Coming Soon website ([cominghomes.com](cominghomes.com)), which gives your property national exposure.&nbsp; This is an exclusive website by the Amy Wengerd Group.&nbsp;

All of this is being done while you prep your home for sale. There are no showings during this time, so you don’t have to worry about that. All of this creates urgency and enthusiasm for your house so that on day one of your listing, we already have buyers waiting to see it. **This program is just one way we can offer you an advantage,** and get you the most money on your largest investment.&nbsp;

Call or email us today if you have any questions about the Coming Soon program or real estate in general. We would love to help you.
