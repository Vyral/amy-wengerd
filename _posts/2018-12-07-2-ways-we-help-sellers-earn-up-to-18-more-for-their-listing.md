We know that your home is your largest investment, so if you’re considering selling your property, what can you do to maximize your earnings?

Today we’d like to share the two tips our team provides sellers to help them earn up to 18% more for their home.

**1. Prepare your home.** Homes that have been prepared for the market actually sell for between 5% to 7% more than listings that aren’t. In other words, your property should be move-in ready. Our team would be happy to help you with this process. We can guide you toward the changes you should and shouldn’t make as you prepare your listing, so that any money spent in the process goes toward bringing you a return. You may be surprised to learn which upgrades and investments are (or aren’t) worth making before you list.

**2. Order a pre-listing inspection.** When you partner with our team, this is something we provide to you at no charge. Essentially, we hire a local inspector to visit your property and check for any structural, mechanical, or safety issues that a buyer might otherwise notice later on in the process. Finding and eliminating these issues before you begin receiving offers will ensure that you remain in control of the deal throughout the transaction. Having a pre-listing inspection could potentially save you thousands.

<br>If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call, send us an email, or visit [www.amysguarantee.com](www.amysguarantee.com). We look forward to hearing from you soon.
