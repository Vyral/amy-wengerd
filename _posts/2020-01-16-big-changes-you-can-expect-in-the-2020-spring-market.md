<center>Here are a few important changes you can expect in the 2020 spring market.</center>

&nbsp;

As laid out in a recent report from CNBC, **here are some trends that have changed how homebuyers will shop for homes in 2020:**

Last year, the number of homes for sale was down by 9.5% annually. From 2015 to 2018, the most popular month for looking at online listings was April, with January lagging behind by a full 16%. In 2019, however, January was the busiest month for Realtor.com because of the high competition for homes.

The search for homes is starting earlier and earlier; **buyers are tired of competing with so many people over one house**. They’re also tired of paying way above the list price and losing their negotiation power.
