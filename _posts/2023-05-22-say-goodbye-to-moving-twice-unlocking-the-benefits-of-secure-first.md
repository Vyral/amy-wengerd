Today, I’m here to talk about one of my team’s most popular programs: Secure First. **This is a new option we created exclusively here at the Amy Wengerd Group to help people who have to sell their current house first before they buy a new one.&nbsp;**

In today’s crazy market, many people have told us that they’re interested in getting a new house for various reasons, but they don’t want to sell their current home because they’re worried they won’t be able to find a new one. People have told us they’ve outgrown their homes, they need something smaller, they need a home that’s all on one floor, and a lot of other things. However, they’re worried about not having a place to go after they sell and they don’t want to move twice.&nbsp;

These conversations are why my team and I came up with the Secure First program. Many of our clients have been loving it, so we truly believe we can help people who want to sell their current home before buying their next one.

With this program, we’ll start by searching for homes. You can I will work to figure out the needs you have, and **once we find a home you love, I will buy it for you.** Once I secure the house and close on it, you’ll know it’ll be there waiting for you! Then you can worry about selling your current home and getting top dollar for it. After you’ve sold your house, you can buy the home from me just like you would from a regular homeowner.&nbsp;

The beauty of this program is you get to secure your new home first. In today’s market, selling is not an issue. Most homes are selling quickly and get multiple offers. **The problem is where to go once you sell, and this program solves that.&nbsp;**

There are, of course, more details that go into this program, but that is a good summary of it. The Secure First program might not be the right fit for you, but I am here to help you figure that out, and fortunately, we have many other programs that can help people in our situation! Therefore, to find out more, feel free to call or email me anytime. I am here to serve you and look forward to talking with you more.&nbsp;
