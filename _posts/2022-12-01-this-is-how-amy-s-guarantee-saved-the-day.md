Many people have been asking me about Amy's Guarantee and if we truly buy someone's house if it doesn't sell well. That’s why today I’m sharing a success story of one of our clients to give you an idea of how the program works.

This past summer, we listed a home for sale that needed quite a bit of repair. After marketing and showings, we received an offer from an agent whose buyer wanted to purchase it. The buyer was using a loan to purchase the home, so they needed to get approved by passing the appraisal and any underwriting conditions. However, this process took longer than expected, and the repair list requirements for the loan were extensive.

Time and money were things the homeowner did not have. She was in a desperate situation, and after extending the closing deadline numerous times, she just could not agree to another extension. She reached out to me to see how we could help.

This is not always how Amy's Guarantee works, and there are lots of other details involved in this story. However, the bottom line is we knew she desperately needed to sell this home and could not wait for the loan to close. Therefore, **we purchased the home from her in cash and closed in almost a week.** She was thrilled to finally have the cash in hand that she needed.

This is just one way that we work creatively and closely with our clients to help them when they need it. If you are thinking about selling or buying a home and need a Realtor that will stand by you through the good and the bad, we would love to help you.
