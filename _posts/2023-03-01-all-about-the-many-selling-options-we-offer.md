In our many years of business, we’ve had a ton of clients who want to go buy a new house but need to sell their current one as well. This can be a tricky process, and most people don’t know how to navigate it. For example, which part of the process do you work on first? If you’re in this situation, you may have a lot of questions, but know that we have it all figured out for you.&nbsp;

**Here at the Amy Wengerd Group, we offer seven exclusive selling options to our clients beyond the traditional way of selling.** Know that not every Realtor or group will offer these options. Most people are familiar with the traditional way to sell, which includes putting a sign in the yard, going through inspections and showings, having appraisals, negotiating, closing, etc.&nbsp;

However, if you have a house to sell first and you want to go buy another one, that requires some strategy. That is why, beyond the traditional selling method, we have seven options available for clients like you to help you navigate your specific situation.

**Of those seven options, only one requires a double move**, which is what a lot of people worry about. They don’t want to have to move into a rental property temporarily just to move into their home soon after. However, this is very rare and only happens when the seller wants to do that. There are six other options available to you.&nbsp;

If you are in this kind of situation, reach out to us. We’d love to walk you through our many options so you can find the best one for you. Call or email us today, and know we’d love to help! We want to lead you to your goals.&nbsp;
