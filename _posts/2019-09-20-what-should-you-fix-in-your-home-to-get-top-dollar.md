{% include youtube.html %}&nbsp;*Before you put your home on the market, there are four repairs and upgrades you should make to ensure you earn top dollar.&nbsp;*

Making certain upgrades and repairs to your home before you list it is a good idea, in general, but did you know that doing so can also help you earn top dollar? Here are four key projects most likely to bring a high return:&nbsp;

**1\. Improve and maintain your home’s curb appeal.** The way your home looks when buyers pull up to it on the street will serve as their first (in-person) impression, so you need to make sure it’s a good one. Trim trees and bushes, add fresh mulch, and plant a few flowers to get everything looking neat and inviting.&nbsp;

<br>**2\. Take care of minor repairs you’ve been putting off.** If you’ve always meant to touch up your paint or fix that hole in your siding, now is the time to do so. Buyers are going to notice every little thing when they look at your home, so make sure there aren’t many issues for them to find before your home goes live on the market.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Declutter.** Cluttered homes look smaller and less clean than they may actually be, which can deter buyers. So as you get ready to sell your home, start packing away, selling, or trashing unwanted items. Your home will look much better once you do. Beyond that, buyers will be able to better envision how they might utilize your home’s space.&nbsp;

<br>**4\. Make sure expensive systems and appliances are functioning properly.** The last thing you want is to go under contract only for the buyer to find out your HVAC unit isn’t functioning properly. These are the sort of problems that home inspections are designed to identify, and leaving them unresolved could cost you your deal.
