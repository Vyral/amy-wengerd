<center>Stressed about your summer home sale? We have a fix for that.</center>

&nbsp;

Selling your home can be a huge hassle if you absolutely need to sell but don’t have the time, money, or energy required to do it well in the traditional fashion. Luckily, we have a program designed for sellers whose chief priority is to have an accelerated, pain-free process. Here’s how our Fast Forward Program works:&nbsp;

1. **You call our office to see if you qualify.&nbsp;**
2. **I figure out your needs.** If you do qualify, I’ll come to your house, discern whether there are any repairs that need to be addressed, and learn more about your particular selling circumstances.&nbsp;
3. **I give you an offer for your home.** Within 72 hours, you’ll hear back from me with a full-fledged offer—it’s literally *that* easy.&nbsp;

If you accept the offer, we can typically schedule the closing within about two weeks (or we can extend it longer if you need it). You’ll be able to fast-forward through all of the prep work, showings, open houses, inspections, appraisal process, and bank paperwork so you can arrive at the closing table and pocket your check.&nbsp;

Not everyone needs the absolute most money out of their home sale; depending on the circumstances (or personal preference), some would rather take a little less money just to have the process completed within a few short weeks.&nbsp;

If this sounds like you, give our team a call today or send us an email. Don’t fret; if it turns out this program isn’t the best way to meet your needs, we sell hundreds of homes every year using our award-winning marketing and my 23 years of real estate experience, so we have you covered either way. Also, feel free to reach out with any and all real estate questions you may have. We look forward to hearing from you\!
