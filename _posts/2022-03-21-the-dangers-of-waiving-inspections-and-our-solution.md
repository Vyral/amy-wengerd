As you know, waiving the home inspection has become more common in real estate transactions these days. With so many buyers competing for each property, this is one strategy they’re using to win.

However, it’s also creating some problems. If buyers move in and they find issues, many of them want the previous homeowner to help pay for the fixes. It would be nice if the world worked like that, but it doesn’t. **When you waive your inspection, the liability falls on you.&nbsp;**

To combat this, I’ve started a program to help both sides of the transaction. For our sellers, I’m paying for a pre-listing home inspection that covers just the major areas of the house. **I’m talking about looking at the electrical, plumbing, roof, and other major systems in a home that can cause problems.&nbsp;**

Then our sellers can make that information available to buyers. It prevents the buyer from being caught off guard by issues and even allows our sellers to fix those issues before listing their homes and possibly get a higher price as a result.

What does this do for buyers? **It lets them waive their inspections with confidence**. You’ll be aware of any problems upfront, and the inspection report will be disclosed. You won’t be caught off guard by any major surprises once you move in.

I am constantly looking for ways to help our clients on both sides of the transaction get through this hectic market. If you have any questions about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
