I’ve been a local Realtor in Northeast Ohio for over 20 years, and because of this, I’m always asked for recommendations on local businesses by my buyers and sellers.

Of course, I’m happy to be a resource to my clients—but I need your help. If you or someone you know has a business who could benefit my clients, please let me know.

**Whatever business you’re connected to, whether it’s house cleaning, handyman services, car repair, a restaurant, or something else entirely, I want to hear about it.**

Buyers who have just come to our area will inevitably be on the hunt for these kinds of businesses and more. This is exactly why I want to hear from you. I want to connect with business owners who know the value of smart marketing, want more business, and who can, hopefully, offer my clients an incentive for providing that business.

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or have a business you would like to share with me, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
