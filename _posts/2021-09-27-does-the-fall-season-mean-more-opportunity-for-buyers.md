What’s going on in our real estate market? There’s been a lot of talk of a slowdown, so let’s look at the numbers and see where things are heading.&nbsp;

First things first, I would like to thank all our clients for a great September. Even though the fall is typically a slower season, this September has been the busiest month the Amy Wengerd Group has ever had. None of this would be possible without you, so I plan to continue to bring you the best service possible.&nbsp;

Now, onto the market. For days on market, the average in Stark County was 27 days. In the last 14 days in Stark County, 167 homes have been sold. Of those 167 sales, 62 sold over asking price. If 32% of homes sold over asking price, **that means we’re still in a strong seller’s market.**

Meanwhile, in Summit County, there were 292 homes sold in the last 14 days. Of those 292, 136 sold over asking price. Also, the average days on market was 25. When 47% of homes are selling over asking price, that means **there are great opportunities for both buyers and sellers.&nbsp;**

One thing I’ve noticed with pricing is that you can’t copy and paste what a similar home recently sold for. If you list at the final, escalated price, you won’t receive as much attention from buyers. If you list your home reasonably, attention from buyers will naturally increase the price. If you list your home high, it will still sell, but you might not get the best deal possible.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about where the market is at or anything else, please reach out to me via phone or email. I am always willing to talk\!
