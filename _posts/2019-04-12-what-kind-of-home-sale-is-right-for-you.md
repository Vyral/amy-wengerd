The current spring market is already shaping up to be quite lively, so if you’ve been thinking of putting your home on the market this year, now may be the perfect time.&nbsp;

With inventory at just three months’ worth of homes in both Stark and Summit County and rates currently at an incredible 4.25% for 30-year fixed mortgages, it’s no wonder why buyers are coming out in droves. As a seller, this means you’ve got a fantastic window of opportunity before you. High demand equates to more money in your pocket, after all.&nbsp;

So if you’re considering a sale, why not let our team help maximize your success? There are three different ways we can help you sell:

**1\. Our traditional sale.** This method is the one we use most. It implements our award-winning, nationally recognized marketing plan, and has been specifically designed to help you sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

<br>**2\. Our guaranteed sale.** If we can’t buy your home within 59 days, we’ll buy it from you directly for a price you agree on up front.&nbsp;

<br>**3\. Our instant offer.** This third method, which is also the latest addition to our repertoire, eliminates the hassle of a traditional selling experience. If you’d rather avoid listing your home on the open market, we’d be happy to make an offer on your home ourselves. All it takes is a simple meeting to talk about your goals. Within 72 hours of that meeting, we’ll present you with an offer and get moving on your home sale.&nbsp;

Whatever option you choose, our goal is to help you sell in a way that best suits your needs.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
