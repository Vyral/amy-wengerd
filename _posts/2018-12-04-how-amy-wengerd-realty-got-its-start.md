On 1480 WHBO, I recently had the chance to share the story of my 21-year-long journey in real estate. Though real estate wasn’t exactly what I’d envisioned for myself from the outset, **it quickly became a career that I could never imagine leaving.**

After leaving my childhood home in Marlington at 18, I spent time in various part-time jobs while living in a trailer. Needless to say, it was during this time I thought to myself: "I’ve got to do something." I wanted to be a surgeon, but we’ll just say that didn’t work out.

Instead, I began talking to someone I knew who worked in real estate. Her pitch about the profession was intriguing—intriguing enough that I quit one of my jobs to work on getting a license. Once I received the license, **I left the other job behind as well and began my career as a real estate agent.**

It wasn’t always easy. My husband traveled a lot during the week and we’d begun having children. I’d be at home showings with children in tow, but thankfully, clients understood my position. Essentially, the kids grew up in the world of real estate.

My son Jake is our courier and he drives to houses to put up signs, take measurements, and much more. After growing up surrounded by the many aspects of real estate, he can now become a part of it.

**We have such a focus on family at Amy Wengerd Realty**—being an agent means spending a lot of time with team members, clients, and other agents, and these people become part of our families. We’re there for each other during the hard days, we share the same goals, and we truly work together as a team.

We have 12 agents on our team, and each agent has a specialty. Some are buyer’s specialists, some are seller’s specialists, and some do everything in between. It’s important to have a good system like we do, especially because we’ve found ourselves selling about a house a day.

I had a great time sharing my story on the radio. **In the next segment, I’ll be talking about the changes I’ve seen in real estate throughout my 21-year career.**

If you want to learn more about our team or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
