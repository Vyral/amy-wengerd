<p style="text-align:center"><em>Our fall market presents a unique opportunity for homebuyers.</em></p>

It’s so hard to believe that we’re nearing the end of 2020, but we can imagine that there aren’t too many of you who are sad to see it go. Even though the year might be winding down, this hot real estate market isn't letting up. Our team doesn't let up, either; we closed almost $10 million worth of real estate in November just last year, which is unprecedented. &nbsp;

**We operate at the same pace all year long.** Seasons are irrelevant to us. This is typically the time of year where a lot of people decide to wait until after the holidays or until next spring to buy their new home, but here’s my question for you: WHY?\!&nbsp;

{% include pullquote.html %}

**Why on earth would you want to do that when we had buyers who were paying 10% to 20% over asking price last spring and all signs point to that same kind of market coming again in spring 2021?** Wouldn’t you want some sort of negotiating power when buying your largest investment? Money is virtually free to borrow right now and historically, sellers are the most desperate and anxious to sell during the winter months. **Assuming another mild winter, everything combined means now is the perfect time to buy.**

If you’ve been considering a home purchase at all, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We would be happy to give you advice and answer any questions you may have.
