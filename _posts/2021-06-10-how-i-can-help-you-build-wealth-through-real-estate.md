I quickly want to speak to all of the current and future real estate investors today. Whether you’re a seasoned investor looking to add to your portfolio or someone who is looking to make their first investment into rental properties,&nbsp; I can help.

**I’m actually working with about 59 private investors right now who are looking to sell.** They’ve given us off-market properties that they are wanting to sell to investors. They’re rentals, duplexes, triplexes, and even vacant houses that need a little bit of work. Basically, they have any kind of property that an investor could want. Most of the properties are in Stark County.

The investors we’re working with prefer cash offers, so if you have the cash on hand, we can get a deal done quickly. **This is a great opportunity to get started on or continue your investment journey.** I’m eager to help you build more wealth through real estate.

If you want to know more, reach out at **[amylwengerd@gmail.com](mailto:amylwengerd@gmail.com)** and let’s get started. If you have any additional real estate-related questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
