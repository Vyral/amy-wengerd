Happy fall, everyone. The Amy Wengerd Group, like many other companies, is experiencing growth right now, and we are in need of members to join our team. **We’re looking for talented individuals to fill a few specific roles.** You are some of the best sources of referrals that we could ask for, so we wanted to give a quick synopsis of what we’re looking for right now.

**The first position is Marketing Coordinator.** We’re looking for someone who’s creative and has skills in videography, photography, and editing. This person will manage our social, digital, and print media platforms. They'll also help us nurture past clients to help us grow even more. We are looking for someone who is also outgoing, forward-thinking, and has experience in helping real estate businesses grow through marketing.

**We’re also looking for a full-time Client Care Specialist.** This person sits at the front of our office, greets people, schedules closings, handles deliveries, and is in close contact with our clients. They call them after they’ve moved in, send cards and gifts, and let our clients always know that we're here for them no matter what. This is a crucial role.&nbsp;

Additionally, if you know of any great handymen, send them our way. With all of the listings we have, we're in desperate need of good, qualified contractors who can communicate well. Tech-savvy handymen are a huge plus.

If you know anyone that would be good for any of these positions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We greatly appreciate all of you, and we hope to hear from you soon.
