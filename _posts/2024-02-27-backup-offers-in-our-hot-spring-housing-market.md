As we head into spring, our housing market is about to heat up. As inventory becomes lower, you need to begin considering backup offers.&nbsp;

It's no secret that housing inventory remains at record lows, and it looks like this trend isnâ€™t going anywhere. When a good property hits the market at an attractive price in a sought-after location, it inevitably draws a flurry of offers.

However, even if a property goes under contract and is no longer actively for sale, **it's still possible to submit a backup offer.** This means acknowledging that while the house is currently under contract, there's no guarantee the sale will close. Issues such as financing complications, appraisal discrepancies, or inspection concerns can derail the process.

Submitting a backup offer positions you as the next in line should the current offer fall through. We can still arrange for you to view the property and negotiate terms with the seller as if you were the primary offer. If the initial offer collapses, the house bypasses the market and goes directly to you, ensuring your offer is immediately accepted.
