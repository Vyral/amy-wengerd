<center>If you&rsquo;re a homeowner, we recommend refinancing now. Here&rsquo;s why.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

If you’re a homeowner who doesn’t have plans to sell, you should consider refinancing right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**15-year mortgages are between 2% and 3%, while 30-year mortgages are just over 3%**. If you’re paying more than this, it’s time to call your favorite lender.

Don’t assume whoever your mortgage is through is your best contact. You can reach out to us and we’ll give you a list of lenders we trust. You’re free to call your current lender, but don’t forget to shop rates to ensure you get the best rate possible. A good rule of thumb is to make sure the rate you get is at least 1% lower to make the refinance worthwhile. For example, if you’re at 4.5% and you can get a 3.5% refinance, go for it\!&nbsp;
