Many of you know that the real estate industry runs on cycles. Winter is seen as a slower season, while springtime is the busiest. Summertime is also somewhat busy and might taper off around the holiday season. But do you know that the market does not only depend on seasonal changes?

The three Ds in real estate are now driving the business and show no signs of slowing down anytime soon. The three Ds are diapers, divorce, and death. Let's delve into the details of each one.

**Diapers.** When you start a family, and your kids start to grow, you will eventually outgrow your house. **It is better to have the foresight to plan for the future and figure out a better housing alternative for your growing family.**

**Divorce.** A lot of clients who are in the process of divorce come to us. This is a delicate topic and a challenging time for individuals. We understand it takes some extra time and care to get through this situation.

**Death.** It is inevitable, and at some point, we will experience death, not only for people we know and love but also for ourselves. When dealing with clients under this circumstance, we contact and recommend reputable estate attorneys in the area to simplify the process and reduce the time spent dealing with paperwork in the courts and the whole probate system.

After going through an estate attorney and only having the house and material assets to liquidate, we've got your back. We can perform cleanouts, sell items for you, give items to local charities, and deliver dumpsters for you. In addition, we can sell the house traditionally by putting it on the market or making an instant cash offer from us or the investors we work with.

To sum it up, the three Ds of real estate are not seasonal; they are based on the natural life cycle throughout the year. If you find yourself in one of these situations, then give us a call or send us an email; we are here to help you day in and day out.
