I get it: We’re all very busy, and life can get crazy in a hurry. However, **if you still want to sell your home for top dollar, you need to make sure the house is in proper condition.** It’s a known fact in real estate that preparing your house is the key to maximizing your sales price. Buyers appreciate it when they can see that you’ve put time and effort into making the property shine.

If you’re concerned about making the necessary repairs to your home, you’re in luck: **Our new Repair & Profit Program is now available to all our selling clients.** With this program, we’ll first sit down with you to learn about your goals and discuss what changes need to be made to your home. Not everyone has that kind of extra money lying around, so when you’ve established which repairs need to be made, we’ll let you borrow the necessary funds to make them. The program gives you the option to make them yourself or hire a professional.

Some restrictions do apply to this program, but if you’d like to learn more about it and how it can help you get the most money possible from your home sale, give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to help you achieve your goals.
