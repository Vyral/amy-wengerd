This is the time of year that homeowners begin asking me questions about selling their home for the most possible money. If selling for the most is your goal, here are three major mistakes that you should avoid making, lest you risk potentially sabotaging your own sale:

**1\. Setting the wrong price.** Overpricing isn’t the only mistake a seller should avoid making; you should also avoid underpricing your home—it may cause them to think that something is wrong with your home. Of course, overpricing can push away buyers who think your home is too expensive. That’s why hiring an experienced agent can save you thousands of dollars and lots of grief.

<br>**2\. Failing to prepare your home for sale.** One of the first things we have to do when selling your home is list it online to the hundreds of different websites where we market homes. That means it’s very important to spend time decluttering, neutralizing, and revamping your curb appeal to make it look its best when our photographer comes to your home. Great listing photos will increase the number of showings you get, which then greatly increases your chances of getting a great offer.

<br>**3\. Turning down showing requests.** Requests to view your home may not always come at the most convenient time, but the more buyers that we can expose your home to early on, the better the chances we have of presenting you with a great offer early on.

If you’re thinking of selling your home, reach out to us. Let’s set up a private tour of your home where we can create a home selling strategically tailored specifically to you.
