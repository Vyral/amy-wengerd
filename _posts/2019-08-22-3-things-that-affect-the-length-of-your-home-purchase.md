Through assisting so many clients, we've gained a thorough understanding of what confuses buyers most about the real estate process. **Here are three key things to remember to make your buying experience a success:**

**1\. The process may take longer than you think.** On average, it can take one to three months for a buyer to find a home that they like. That’s assuming that all the good houses are available and not flying off the market like they did this last spring.

**2\.****Once your offer is accepted, the bank will take approximately 40 days to process and approve your loan.**

**3\.****The homeowner may ask for additional time to stay in the house after closing.** This is negotiable, but it should be something that you account for when you’re calculating your timeline.

In the end, it could take four to five months for you to get into your new home when all is said and done. **If you want to be in your new home by the holidays, you should give us a call today to get the process started.** We’ll make sure it’s as smooth and fun as possible.
