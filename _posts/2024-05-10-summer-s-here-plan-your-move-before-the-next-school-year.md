Summer is fast approaching, and with this season, a lot of parents are looking to take advantage of relocating before the next school year starts. This season is a critical time, which is why you should make a move as early as now.

**So why should you start planning now?** One of the reasons that you should get started on finding your next home is the lack of inventory. This means that it will take a bit longer for you to find a house. The same is true if you want to sell your house; you need time to plan on how to sell it as well.
