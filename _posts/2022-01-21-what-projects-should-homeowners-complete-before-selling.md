We’ve been receiving a ton of calls from homeowners lately who are interested in listing their homes this spring. They want to know what they should add or upgrade in their homes before they sell. Many think they need a full kitchen or basement remodel to get the best return on investment. Most of the time, what they should actually focus on surprises them. Today I’ll go over some of the easy things you can do to get the best possible return.

**Most times when we meet with homeowners and evaluate their houses, we don’t need to do the majority of things the sellers think they need to do.** We’ve found that just cleaning the carpets will get a great ROI. Touching up your paint is an inexpensive fix, too. You might just need to re-paint a room or two.

Decluttering is another great tip. We all accumulate stuff over the years that we like to hang onto, but the more you can pack away while you’re selling your home, the better. The best way to get the best pictures of your property is to declutter your rooms to help them look better for photos. You're going to move anyway, so you might as well start a little early.

**Curb appeal is another area of focus that brings a great return on investment.** A pop of color here and fresh mulch there can have a huge impact on how buyers perceive your property.

My main point for today is that **you don’t have to necessarily make those large, expensive upgrades and finishes to get the best return on your investment.** There are lots of things you can do to make your home appealing and increase your sale price without breaking the bank. It’s a service that we’re happy to provide here at The Amy Wengerd Group.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for me about selling your home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
