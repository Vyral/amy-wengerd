<center>If you&rsquo;re in the market to sell your home, you need to know that all home remodel projects aren&rsquo;t created equal. Here&rsquo;s where you can get the best bang for your buck.</center>

If you’re in the market to sell your home and wondering what you can do before selling to get the highest possible sale price, I have some great advice today. Many homeowners will spend a lot of money on upgrades and improvements that they think homeowners will appreciate, only to find out later that buyers won’t pay extra for it. **Here are four things that you should keep in mind when determining what you should do before selling:**

**1\. Be cautious about installing a pool in Northeast Ohio.** Our pool season, unfortunately, is very short. Homebuyers just aren’t willing to pay dollar for dollar for this improvement. If you’re not going to sell right away and your family loves the pool, then spend away. Just know that if you spend $30,000 on a pool it doesn’t make your home worth $30,000 more.

**2\. Consider how long you’re going to live in the house before taking on a big project.** For example, if you want to install a gourmet kitchen with all the bells and whistles, you would need to stay in the house for 10-15 years to recoup that investment from an ROI perspective.

**3\. A small bathroom expansion or remodel is one of the best improvements you can make.** It can be done relatively inexpensively and yield a great return.

**4\. When it’s time to sell, it’s important to neutralize your colors and return rooms to their intended purposes.** If you have an extra bedroom that you use for an office or a gym, we always suggest that you convert that back to a bedroom or whatever its intended use is.

If you have other questions about selling a home or anything else related to real estate, feel free to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
