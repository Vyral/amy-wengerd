I’ve been selling real estate for two decades, so as you can imagine, I meet homeowners who have many different needs.

Every now and then, we meet with someone who doesn’t need to sell quickly. For everyone else, though, selling a home can be scary and overwhelming, and they don’t like the idea of strangers viewing their home for weeks or months on end.

Sometimes, we deal with people who have to sell their loved one’s home from a different state. In other cases, it’s someone who just loves the convenience of a quick sale and would rather not deal with an investor who’s going to give them 50 or 60 cents on the dollar for their largest investment.

It’s because of these types of situations that we created the Fast Forward Program. How does it work? There are three steps involved:

**1. We set an appointment to view your home and discuss your goals.**

**2. We give you your home’s current market value.**

**3. We provide you with an offer to purchase your home within 72 hours.**

This is just another way we help Northeast Ohio home sellers and provide them with as many options as possible to get their home sold.  

On average, we sell a home every 24 hours just by using our proven, nationally recognized marketing program, so either way, we have your home sale covered.

If you have any questions about how this program works or you’re thinking of selling your home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
