I was recently honored to be a guest on 1480 WHBC Radio’s “Spotlight on Star County” to talk a little bit about how the real estate market has changed since I’ve been in business, what the current market looks like, and much more. Here’s an outline of our great discussion, with timestamps so you can skip around to the part(s) that interest you most:

0:30- What the market was like when I started out in the business over 20 years ago.

2:00- The massive impact of the market crash on real estate and what things look like now that we’ve recovered.

5:00- How the current market can be discouraging for homebuyers and how we’re being more creative with the offers our buyers make.

7:30- Why our team’s fine-tuned systems help transactions run more smoothly.

10:30- Is it a good time to buy right now?

13:10- A closer look at our annual Thanksgiving pie giveaway and how it has changed over the years.

15:30- An explanation of our home sale guarantee and how it came to be.

17:45- A few of the unique solutions we’ve used to help our past, present, and future clients.

Thanks again to Pam for having me on the show. If you have any questions for me about anything I discussed on the radio or anything else about real estate, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
