Most of you probably remember that crazy windstorm we experienced a couple weeks ago. If so, let me ask you: Have you had your roof checked out since then? Unless the wind visibly damaged your home, you probably haven’t thought about it much. The good news is that we know of a company who will do a free roof inspection for you, inform you if your roof did, in fact, suffer wind damage, and tell you if you are eligible to get a new roof by filing an insurance claim. The message is just another way that we help make sure our homeowners are getting the best possible customer service. If you’d like to take advantage of this opportunity, all you need to do is reach out to us.
