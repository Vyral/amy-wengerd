Everyone is talking about having low inventory in today’s real estate market. But even with low inventory, bidding wars and instant sales are no longer the norm. This shift has created an interesting market for sellers, so today, I’m sharing my thoughts on how you should respond to recent shifts when selling your home:&nbsp;

**1\. Strategic pricing.** While some homes, particularly those priced for first-time buyers, are still selling quickly, others have been sitting on the market for weeks. Sellers who overprice or try to test the market find themselves reducing their prices multiple times before receiving offers.

**2\. Rising interest rates.** Compared to two years ago,&nbsp; interest rates have doubled, affecting affordability for buyers.

**3\. Inflation.** The current economic climate with rising inflation means buyers have less disposable income and are more cautious with their spending, which includes housing, which is their largest monthly expense.

**4\. Return of buyer inspections and appraisals.** Unlike before, buyers are now more likely to request repairs during inspections, and appraisals may come in lower than the agreed-upon sale price.
