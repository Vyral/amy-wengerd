We’re definitely feeling the spring market here at the Amy Wengerd Group, and it’s so exciting. I’m sure you’ve heard about all the offers that homes for sale are receiving and the terms that are being negotiated. Some homes are selling for 20% or even 30% over asking price\! Buyers are even offering to pay for the seller’s closing costs, and many are willing to bridge the gap if the appraisal comes in lower than the asking price. **Buyers are willing to do almost anything to secure a house in our market.**

While we have to educate our buyers that this is what they’re up against, something feels wrong about telling them that they have to pay that much more than the asking price in order to win a home. After all, we are concerned about our buyers’ futures, and nobody can predict with certainty what’s going to happen down the road.

**That’s why we’re committed to educating you about how this market works and providing you with every possible option to secure your next purchase.** Armed with this knowledge, you can then make an informed decision about whether or not this is the market you want to buy in. if you don’t want to buy in this market, we’d totally understand. It might be better in some situations to put the home purchase on hold until the market cools down some.

However, I do want to offer a ray of hope to all the homebuyers out there. **Year to date, we have saved our buyers $137,800 on the asking price of the homes they have purchased.** That’s huge, especially considering that that’s over a 3.5-month period. Our buyers went through the whole process, did their inspections, and didn’t all have to pay way more than asking price for their homes. In one case, a buyer paid $20,000 under asking price\!

If you’re looking to buy a home, know that there are options available to you. We help people overcome obstacles every day, and we’d love to help you, too. Don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email if you have any questions or need assistance with your home purchase. We hope to hear from you soon.
