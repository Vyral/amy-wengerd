It’s been about a month since my last market update, and some things have happened in that time. I wanted to keep you all updated on our market, so I’ve put together some more stats to look at today:

**Stark County**

* 421 homes for sale
* 33 days on market on average
* $239,000 average sales price

Last month, the average days on market was 27, so homes are taking a bit longer to sell on average.

**Summit County**

* 727 homes for sale
* 34 days on market on average
* $275,000 average sales price

A month ago, the average days on market was 25. Homes are taking nine days longer to sell on average. This is very natural as we move towards the holidays season, and things start to slow down a little.

In Stark County, 469 homes have been sold in the last 30 days. That’s more than we have for sale right now, which means **we have less than a 30-day supply of homes on the market.** The same is true for Summit County, which had 755 sales over the last 30 days.

**All of this means that we are still in a very strong seller’s market.** Homes are taking a bit longer to sell. Sellers in Stark County are getting 103% over the asking price on average, and in Summit County, they’re selling for 99.6% of the asking price on average.

Overall, it’s good news for both buyers and sellers. If you need any help at all in buying, selling, or just answering some real estate questions, please give me a call. I am confident that I can help you.
