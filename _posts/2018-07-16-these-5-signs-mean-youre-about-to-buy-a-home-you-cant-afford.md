Are you interested in buying a house but aren’t sure you can afford it? Here are five signs you should watch out for that mean you’re about to buy something you can’t afford:

**1. There are creative mortgage terms in your loan.** If the conditions of your financing look like a trail mix of mortgages and involve terms like “interest only,” “balloon payment,” “second mortgage,” or “adjustable rate,” that’s a significant indicator that you can’t afford the home you’re looking to buy.

**2. You’re relying on down payment assistance programs.** These can be helpful if used properly. However, if you’re not prepared for the financial aspects of purchasing and owning a home, moving into one before you’re ready, or moving into one you can’t afford without the assistance, will do more harm than good.

**3. You have just enough to cover the monthly mortgage payment.** There will always be additional expenses to owning a home, so you want to have extra money set aside for any surprises that might pop up.

**4. You’re borrowing from a retirement account.**

**5. You have a sinking feeling.** We always say that no matter what anyone else says, trust your gut. If you don’t feel 100% sure you can handle the investment, wait until you are 100% sure.
