<center>Here are four tips that will strengthen your home&rsquo;s curb appeal.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

Many home sellers spend so much time prepping the inside of their home for sale that they forget how important curb appeal is to potential homebuyers. Not only does the exterior of your home give buyers a hint of the interior’s condition, but it also has a direct impact on the number of showings your home generates.&nbsp;

That being said, here are four ways you can improve your curb appeal and help get top dollar for your home:

1. **Power wash.** Not only will this bring your home back to life, but it will brighten your driveway and sidewalks as well. You might be surprised at how your home looks after the power wash is done.&nbsp;
2. **Paint the front door.** This is what buyers first see, so a fresh coat of paint can make a great first impression.&nbsp;
3. **Add flowers.** These add color and character to your house, and it’s another way to show buyers you care about your home and how it looks.&nbsp;
4. **Lay down a doormat.** Did you know that when a buyer visits your home, they spend approximately 30 seconds to a full minute on the front porch while their Realtor is unlocking and opening the door? Can you guess what they’re doing during that time? That’s right—they’re checking out the space, including the front door and doormat, and seeing whether any maintenance is needed.&nbsp;

If you list with us, we’ll give you a free doormat\! In fact, we can help you with all of these tasks. We’ve got you covered no matter what. We’re here to help with the little things and big decisions.&nbsp;
