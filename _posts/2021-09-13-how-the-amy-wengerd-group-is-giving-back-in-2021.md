This year has flown by. Can you believe it’s already September? As we get ready to enter the fall season, we’re anticipating a time where we can reflect on this past year, look at our failures and accomplishments, and appreciate all we’ve done to help others.

One thing we’re proud of is helping our local charities. Today I wanted to bring attention to some of the amazing people doing fantastic things in our community that we are happy to support.

On September 23, we’ll be sponsoring Simply Give for the seventh consecutive year. It’s an amazing local nonprofit that teaches us to be better people and take care of each other. We look forward to sponsoring their cancer outreach later this month by assembling over 500 chemotherapy bags for local cancer centers to deliver to patients bravely fighting for their lives. **We're so thankful to play a small part in helping this great charity.**

Another fantastic community event we love to support is Bosom Buddies, along with WQMX 94.9 and Scott Wynn. That’s coming up in October for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

We’ve also been blessed to work with Neopat to help support local military families who have a significant other stationed abroad. Overseas service can leave a big gap in households, and we’re proud to support the vital work they’re doing.

We love our community, we love the people we serve, and we love to be able to give back. If you are able, **please support these great local organizations.** If you have any questions for me or real estate needs I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
