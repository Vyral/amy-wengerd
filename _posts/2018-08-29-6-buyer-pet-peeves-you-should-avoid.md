I’ve spent some time in the past talking to you about fun things that you can do with your home if you don’t want to sell, but what if you do want to list it? The first thing you should do is call us so we can guide you through every step of the way. There are also some things you can avoid to make sure you get top dollar for your home whenever you do sell. **Here are six buyer pet peeves you need to steer clear of:**

**1. Damp patches or stains on the walls or ceilings.** 75% of buyers are put off by this. Go through the house, look up, and make sure there are no indications of these ossies. If you do have them, find out what’s causing them and get it fixed.

**2. Unpleasant odors.** 56% of buyers are turned off by various odors. They can come from pets, dampness, or even teenagers.

**3. Dull light.** 54% of buyers mention dull light as a turn-off. It’s important to showcase your house and show it in its best light, both literally and figuratively. It’s all about that emotion and feeling that buyers have when they walk into your house. We want them to feel great and feel invited.

**4. Cluttered rooms.** This will disappoint another 15% of buyers. We all have clutter, but when it’s time to sell, it’s important to declutter to make the home look as roomy and spacious as possible. This will not only help with photographs, but it will also help with buyers visualizing how they will live there.

**5. Over-the-top-decor.** Less is more, folks. I get it. You want to have all of your collectibles out, but save those for the new house. The selling process should be clear of valuables, not only to minimize the risk to your items, but to show off the space in the home better.

**6. Outdated bathrooms.** This is unappealing to 25% of buyers, but there are some quick fixes you can make. Repainting, fresh new lighting, new plumbing fixtures, and fresh soap on the counter can make the space feel new without the need to remodel.

If you have any more questions for us or want any more tips about how to prepare your home for sale, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
