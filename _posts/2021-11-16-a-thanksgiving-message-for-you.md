Happy Thanksgiving\! We’ve almost made it through 2021, and what a year it has been. Today I just wanted to say a very special thank you to the clients that we’ve been able to serve this year, those who have put their trust in us, and those of you who have sent us referrals. **I hope that your Thanksgiving is wonderful**, your Christmas is fantastic, and your new year is blessed and filled with all the things you’re hoping it will contain.&nbsp;

I can’t wait to see all of our present and past clients at our upcoming pie giveaway\! If you haven’t RSVP'd yet, please do. It may be too late to RSVP by the time you see this, but we also might have some extra pie to share anyway.

If you’re considering buying or selling, I’d love to speak with you about why **the holiday and winter seasons can be an excellent time to enter the real estate market.** I love providing the stats so you know exactly where you are in the current market and can make the best decisions for yourself and your family.&nbsp;

Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts, from me, my family, and all of our agents here. Have an exceptional holiday season\!<br>&nbsp;
