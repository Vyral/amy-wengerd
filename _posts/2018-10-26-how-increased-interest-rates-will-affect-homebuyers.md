Numerous people have asked me lately how the recent increases in interest rates will affect them as future homebuyers. It’s a good question, as interest rates are the highest they’ve been since May 2011. **Let me explain what it means for those who want to purchase a home:**

This time last year, in the 4th quarter of 2017, the principal and interest payment on a $150,000 home was $760. Now, with those interest rates at 5%, the same payment would be $810. **That’s a $50 increase in a very short period of time.**
