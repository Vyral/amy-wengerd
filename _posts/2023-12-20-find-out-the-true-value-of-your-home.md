Have you ever wondered what the most common question that Realtors receive? For me, it’s "What's my house worth?" Understanding the dynamics of the real estate market, especially when it comes to our homes, is crucial. After all, our homes represent not just a place to live but also our most substantial investment.

**If you’re considering a move, know that timing is everything.** Knowing the optimal time to sell or buy, when to retire and relocate, are all pivotal decisions. Questions like "What's my house worth?" and "What's happening in my neighborhood?" are more pertinent now than ever.
