Can you believe we are officially in 2023? We have already started to get phone calls with many concerns because of the market shifting, and we are here to help with those. Many buyers are wondering about what options we offer that can help them, so that’s what we’re going to cover today.&nbsp;

Of course, **we offer traditional marketing, which is how we sell most of our clients’ homes.** This includes showings, appraisals, inspections, and putting a sign in the yard. However, another avenue that’s available to everyone is our Instant Offer program.

**With this program, the home isn’t listed on the MLS, there won’t be any showings, and you’ll get a cash offer within 72 hours of us visiting your property.** This means that you could close in two weeks or less, but we can also make the closing date longer if that suits your needs better.&nbsp;

This program is great for people who have rental properties or portfolio homes that they don’t want anymore, and it’s great for selling your personal home if you don’t want all the hassle that comes with a traditional sale.&nbsp;

Just know that we have multiple ways to get your home sold here at the Wengerd Group. If you or anyone you know might be interested in an instant offer, please reach out\! Call or email me anytime, as I would love to help.&nbsp;
