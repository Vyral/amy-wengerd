As we step into the new year, I like to look back and analyze the shifts in the real estate landscape from 2022 to 2023. In this post, I'll personally take you through a comparison of significant real estate metrics between these two years for both Stark and Summit County. Join me on this journey as we explore the transformations that unfolded in the realm of real estate.

In 2022, Stark County witnessed a total of 4,500 home sales, boasting an average sale price of $207,000. Homes in this region typically flew off the market within a mere 29 days. Fast forward to 2023, and we observed a notable shift. The county recorded 3,700 home sales, but here's the exciting part - the average sale price surged to $221,000, marking an impressive 6.2% appreciation from the previous year. **However, the average time it took to sell homes extended to 35 days, representing an 18% increase compared to 2022.**

Shifting our focus to Summit County, the stats for 2022 showcased a thriving real estate scene with 7,600 home sales, an average sale price of $229,000, and homes typically spending around 31 days on the market. In 2023, Summit County experienced a slight dip in home sales, recording 6,300 transactions. However, what caught my attention was the increase in the average sale price, which climbed to $234,000, indicating a modest 2.1% growth. Interestingly, homes in Summit County took slightly longer to sell, with an average of 37 days on the market.

In summary, both Stark and Summit County underwent a shared experience of a 17% drop in the number of home sales from 2022 to 2023. However, the real estate market displayed remarkable resilience. Homes appreciated in value, and approximately 32% of homeowners had to make at least one price adjustment before securing a sale, a trend that seemingly favored buyers.

**As we cast our gaze into 2024, the anticipation of rate cuts paints a promising picture.** We can expect more homeowners to list their properties, and the persistently high demand will keep prices steady, offering buyers the advantage of lower interest rates. Although the need for more homes on the market remains, the overall outlook for the real estate sector remains quite optimistic.
