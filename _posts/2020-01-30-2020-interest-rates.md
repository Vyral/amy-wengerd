<center>I&rsquo;m sharing what our interest rate predictions could do for you in 2020.</center>

&nbsp;

Hello Northeast Ohio\! Most of you likely haven’t heard the interest rate predictions for this year. Analysts are saying they could drop as low as 3.4%\! What does that mean for you as a homebuyer?&nbsp;

I’ll give you a few examples, and each one assumes. In the following examples, payment assumes that the analysts’ predictions of a possible 3.4% interest rate this year come true. Also, this is with an FHA loan and a 3.5% down payment.&nbsp;

On a $100,000 house, your payment would be roughly $675. On a loan of $150,000, your payment could run about $995. On a $200,000 loan, you’re looking at $1,290 for a payment. **These are some incredibly affordable payments** to either help you own your first home or to downsize.&nbsp;
