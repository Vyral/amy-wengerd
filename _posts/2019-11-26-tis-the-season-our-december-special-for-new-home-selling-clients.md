&nbsp;

To show our appreciation for all the love and support we’ve received over the course of this year, **we’re extending a special offer to all new homeowners who list their homes with us during the month of December:** We will pay the cost of a one-year home warranty for your home sale—a $425-value\! This allows us to market your home to buyers as a warranty-protected property for the first year that they live in the home.

This is just our way of saying thank you to those who trust us with the largest investments of their lives. The offer ends on December 31, so if you need to sell your home before 2020, I encourage you to reach out to us as soon as possible. We’d love to help you\!
