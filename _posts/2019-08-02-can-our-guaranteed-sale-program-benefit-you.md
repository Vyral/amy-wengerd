We at The Amy Wengerd Group have been offering our Guaranteed Sale program to our clients for more than six years. Much to their satisfaction, we recently helped seven clients sell their home using this very program.&nbsp;

But how will you know if this program is right for you? Here are five scenarios where our Guaranteed Sale program is just what the doctor ordered:&nbsp;

**1\. You want to make an offer on a new home without worrying about the sale of your current home&nbsp;**

**2\. You want to know what you can expect and what you’ll net from your sale**

**3\. You want to know that your home will sell in 59 days or less&nbsp;**

**4\. You want the freedom to make solid plans and not worry about your sale&nbsp;**

**5\. You have equity in your home and want the peace of mind that comes with a sale &nbsp;**

<br>The bottom line is we’ll strive to get you the most money out of your sale, whether it’s through a traditional channel, our Guaranteed Sale program, or our new instant offer program, your goals are our goals.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or would like to meet with one of our seller specialists to learn the specifics of our program, please give me or my team a call today. We look forward to serving you\! &nbsp;
