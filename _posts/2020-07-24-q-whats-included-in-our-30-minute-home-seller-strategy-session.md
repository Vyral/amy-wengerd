<center>Here&rsquo;s what sellers can learn in our strategy session.&nbsp;</center>

&nbsp;

We hope you’re enjoying your summer so far and have made some great memories with your friends and family.&nbsp;

Speaking of friends and family, that’s exactly how the Amy Wengerd Group likes to treat our clients. One of the most common calls we get is from homeowners asking us to help them prep their home for sale. Many people aren’t sure where to spend their money or what projects they need to work on to get the best return on investment, and that’s where we come in.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about selling, we’re offering a free, 30-minute strategy session. **Here are just a few items of value you’ll receive during your session:**

1\. Which projects you should (and shouldn’t) spend money on.

2\. Advice on preparing your home for sale—including staging tips, recommendations for which items to stow away, etc.&nbsp;

3\. A value range for your home in the current market. We know that you may not be ready to sell quite yet, but you’d still like to understand your value range so you can know which projects to focus on. That’s what we’ll help you with\!

4\. A list of handymen and contractors if you need help with the work that needs to be done.&nbsp;

Once you’re closer to listing your home, we’ll meet again to narrow down your pricing and tell you all about our proven marketing system.&nbsp;

**If you’d like to take advantage of this offer, give us a call today.** If you have any other real estate questions we can answer, feel free to reach out to us as well. We’re here to help.
