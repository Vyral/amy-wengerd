As you can see, I’m holding a stack of papers, and printed on these papers are **absorption rates** that we track week to week. To better understand the market’s state at a given time, many buyers and sellers come to us asking about supply and demand in their particular area.&nbsp;

Absorption rate data is divided into area, county, and the townships and cities located within them. Let’s explore how instrumental this data is in serving our clients a little further:&nbsp;

Last year in North Canton, there was just a one month’s supply of homes in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range. Fast forward to 2019: We now have a three-month supply of homes in that same price range. With respect to those homes, this points to a slowdown in sales and more inventory from one year to the next. &nbsp;

With all that in mind, we’ll advise our sellers whose home falls within that price point to yield to these conditions and to lean more toward a competitive pricing strategy.

As for our buyers, we'll share the encouraging news that there are more homes available in that price range than there were just a year earlier. We can also show them the data for the $300,000 to $350,000 range and, in this particular case, it only gets better: Inventory jumps from a three-month supply to a 7.5-month supply.&nbsp;

All of this is made possible by absorption rate data, and **by careful comparison and analysis, we can advise both our buyers and sellers based on the numbers for that particular week.** No matter if you’re a buyer or seller, please reach out to us and let us put our experience and expertise to work for you. We hope to hear from you very soon\! &nbsp;
