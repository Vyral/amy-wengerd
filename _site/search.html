If not, you&rsquo;ll want to see today&rsquo;s post.Â If youâre a homeowner who wants to buy a home before selling your current one, youâll definitely want to hear about our Recasting Program. Hereâs how it works:Letâs say that you qualified to carry both your new home and your current home mortgages. Letâs also say that you donât want to sell your home until you know that you have a place to go.âSo many people have benefited from this program.âUnder our recasting program, our lenders will allow you to purchase the new home with the minimum down payment, and when your current home closes, you can apply whatever amount youâd like to your new mortgage payment. Even more than that, once you apply the amount toward your mortgage, you could then have that payment adjusted down to reflect the new mortgage balance without adjusting the term or interest rate.So many people have benefited from this program and we wanted to make sure that you had this information at your disposal, as well. Consider this just another tool in your pocket.If you have any questions about this or other programs that we offer, go ahead and reach out to us. Weâd love to meet with you to help you make the best real estate decisions for your situation.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are the top five reasons that homebuyers should hire an exclusive buyer specialist to assist them in their purchase.Â The Amy Wengerd Group has created an exclusive group of buyer specialists who are not only licensed Realtors, but who have also gone through extensive additional training before ever even serving one of our clients. Here are the top five reasons that homebuyers should hire an exclusive buyer specialist:1. Sellers have exclusive representation of their own, so why shouldnât you as a buyer? The seller has hired and contracted an agent to get them the most money out of their house in any given market. However, as a buyer, you want to get the best deal (i.e., the lowest price) for a home.2. Buyer representation is virtually free. Most agencies will charge a buyer anywhere from $200 to $500 for their services to be paid at closing. The seller always pays the commission of the agent who represents you, so you donât have to worry about paying a commission. Youâll typically only have to pay a small fee to the brokerage, but the amount of help you receive in return is invaluable.âThe seller always pays the commission of the agent who represents you, so you donât have to worry about paying a commission.â3. You only need to call your buyer specialist when you have a question about a listing. They can answer all of your questions, show you any house, advise you on the market, and so much more. Wouldnât that be so much easier than clicking through all the different websites and contacting numerous Realtors about all the different properties, waiting for the calls back, and trying to figure out which Realtor called you about which house? It gets a little overwhelming.4. Our buyer clients enjoy certain benefits, like being able to use our moving truck for free and receiving a discount card. Plus, they have a team helping out who make sure the buyers never miss out on the home of their dreams. Theyâll also receive invitations to our special events, giveaways, and so much more.5. Year to date, our buyer agents have saved their clients over $543,000 on their home purchases.Contact us today so you can get started. Let us help you make the perfect match with one of our buyer specialists so we can get you into your dream home this yearâthereâs still plenty of time.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "There are three ways you can tell if your home is overpriced.&nbsp;Â Many homeowners come to us to voice their frustration that their home hasnât sold, and almost every time, the reason why boils down to overpricing.Â We at the Amy Wengerd Group always try to get the most money possible for our sellers no matter which market weâre in, and sometimes they prefer to list their house above our suggested price, and thatâs fine. But what if you picked an agent with a great reputation and marketing plan and your home still isnât selling?Here are the three ways to know if your home is overpriced:1. No buyers or Realtors are contacting you about the house. This means no emails, texts, phone calls, etc.Â âYou always want to net the most money possible from your home sale, but you donât want to sabotage it by pricing your home too high.â2. Your home has showings, but no offers. In this situation, youâll hear buyers tell you that theyâd like to keep looking, or the house just isnât for them, or they found something they liked better. Usually, this means they liked what they saw online, but they decided the home wasnât a good value in person. In other words, youâre helping to sell the competition.3. Potential buyers are making lowball offers. This doesnât mean they want to âsteal your house.â They may like it, but feel as though the price doesnât align with current market conditions.Â You always want to net the most money possible from your home sale, but you donât want to sabotage it by pricing your home too high.Â If youâd like some guidance on how to navigate this tricky process, donât hesitate to give our team a call.

Here&rsquo;s why.&nbsp;Investors and homeowners, take note: My team is having so much success that we want to remind you once more about the newest program weâre offering to you. Itâs called the Fast Forward Program, and weâve had numerous home sellers already take advantage of it. There are four reasons, specifically, why this program may be your best option.Â 1.

        "content": "Before you put your home on the market, there are four repairs and upgrades you should make to ensure you earn top dollar.Â Â Making certain upgrades and repairs to your home before you list it is a good idea, in general, but did you know that doing so can also help you earn top dollar? Here are four key projects most likely to bring a high return:Â 1. Improve and maintain your homeâs curb appeal. The way your home looks when buyers pull up to it on the street will serve as their first (in-person) impression, so you need to make sure itâs a good one. Trim trees and bushes, add fresh mulch, and plant a few flowers to get everything looking neat and inviting.Â 2. Take care of minor repairs youâve been putting off. If youâve always meant to touch up your paint or fix that hole in your siding, now is the time to do so. Buyers are going to notice every little thing when they look at your home, so make sure there arenât many issues for them to find before your home goes live on the market.Â âBuyers will be able to better envision how they might utilize your homeâs space after itâs been decluttered.â3. Declutter. Cluttered homes look smaller and less clean than they may actually be, which can deter buyers. So as you get ready to sell your home, start packing away, selling, or trashing unwanted items. Your home will look much better once you do. Beyond that, buyers will be able to better envision how they might utilize your homeâs space.Â 4. Make sure expensive systems and appliances are functioning properly. The last thing you want is to go under contract only for the buyer to find out your HVAC unit isnât functioning properly. These are the sort of problems that home inspections are designed to identify, and leaving them unresolved could cost you your deal.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Here are three key things to remember to make your buying experience a success:1. The process may take longer than you think. On average, it can take one to three months for a buyer to find a home that they like. Thatâs assuming that all the good houses are available and not flying off the market like they did this last spring.âIt could take five months or more from start to finish.â2.Once your offer is accepted, the bank will take approximately 40 days to process and approve your loan.3.The homeowner may ask for additional time to stay in the house after closing. This is negotiable, but it should be something that you account for when youâre calculating your timeline.In the end, it could take four to five months for you to get into your new home when all is said and done.

        "content": "Homebuyers often ask if itâs worth it to spend the money to hire a professional home inspector. As it turns out, there are three key reasons why you should engage the services of an experienced inspector before you buy a home:1. Youâll gain a better understanding of your new home. Not only does a home inspector point out issues of concern, but they also answer any and all questions you might have about the systems in the house. Every house is different, so making sure that you have a good understanding of your new home is important.2. Theyâll find both current and future issues with the home. A home inspector wonât just find issues that currently beset the property, but they can also tell you which issues are most likely to arise in the future. Itâs a really good idea to start a plan for home improvements in the future if you donât want to be blindsided by costly repairs down the road.âWithout the inspectorâs report, itâs virtually impossible for us to address any repair issues with the homeowner.â3. Home inspections will allow us to negotiate home repairs with the seller. A great inspector will provide you with a thorough report, complete with pictures and details, within 24 hours of your inspection. Without that report, itâs virtually impossible for us to address any repair issues with the homeowner.No matter what, we want to make sure that our homebuyers have the most information available when undergoing what is likely the largest investment of their lives. We work with some of the best home inspectors in the area, and we can even help you purchase a home warranty.If you are in need of assistance in your next real estate purchase, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

To better understand the marketâs state at a given time, many buyers and sellers come to us asking about supply and demand in their particular area.Â Absorption rate data is divided into area, county, and the townships and cities located within them. Letâs explore how instrumental this data is in serving our clients a little further:Â Last year in North Canton, there was just a one monthâs supply of homes in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range. Fast forward to 2019: We now have a three-month supply of homes in that same price range. With respect to those homes, this points to a slowdown in sales and more inventory from one year to the next. Â âBy careful comparison and analysis of absorption rate data, we can advise both our buyers and sellers based on the numbers for that particular week.âWith all that in mind, weâll advise our sellers whose home falls within that price point to yield to these conditions and to lean more toward a competitive pricing strategy.As for our buyers, weâll share the encouraging news that there are more homes available in that price range than there were just a year earlier. We can also show them the data for the $300,000 to $350,000 range and, in this particular case, it only gets better: Inventory jumps from a three-month supply to a 7.5-month supply.Â All of this is made possible by absorption rate data, and by careful comparison and analysis, we can advise both our buyers and sellers based on the numbers for that particular week. No matter if youâre a buyer or seller, please reach out to us and let us put our experience and expertise to work for you. We hope to hear from you very soon! Â ",

        "content": "Perhaps simultaneously buying a new home and selling your current home is an approach that lines up with your real estate goals. If thatâs the case, there are three solutions to help you maneuver through the process smoothly:Â Speak with a reputable lender to learn all your options first. Your lender may reveal that you have enough equity in your current home to extract and use as a down payment on your new homeâwhatâs known as a bridge loan. We have lenders who can help you with this option.Â If youâre selling first, place a contingency offer on your new home. With this contingency, any purchase you make hinges on the sale of your current home. Until then, youâre not obligated to go through with buying a home.Â âYour lender may reveal that you have enough equity in your current home to extract and use as a down payment on your new home.âIt will also allow us to extend the closing date on your purchase if necessary. Say our original closing date is set for May 25, which would mean your first payment is scheduled for July 1. By extending your closing date to June 1, though, your first payment wonât be due until August 1âthat one extra week gives us a much larger window of time to sell your home.Â Finally, sell your home through our exclusive guaranteed sale program. Youâve heard it on the radio and weâve said it for years: If we canât sell your home through the traditional course in 59 days or less, we will buy the home ourselves. Youâll be made aware of the buyout price and any fees up front so you can plan for your next purchase without any uncertainty about your home sale.Â What if youâre already eyeing a property you love, and youâd like to make a speedy sale? No worries! We can even give you an instant offer on your home, in which you can set the closing date.Â As you can see, we have just about every situation covered for your specific buyer and seller needs.

If selling for the most is your goal, here are three major mistakes that you should avoid making, lest you risk potentially sabotaging your own sale:1. Setting the wrong price. Overpricing isnât the only mistake a seller should avoid making; you should also avoid underpricing your homeâit may cause them to think that something is wrong with your home. Of course, overpricing can push away buyers who think your home is too expensive. Thatâs why hiring an experienced agent can save you thousands of dollars and lots of grief.âThe more buyers that we can expose your home to early on, the better the chances we have of presenting you with a great offer early on.â2. Failing to prepare your home for sale. One of the first things we have to do when selling your home is list it online to the hundreds of different websites where we market homes. That means itâs very important to spend time decluttering, neutralizing, and revamping your curb appeal to make it look its best when our photographer comes to your home. Great listing photos will increase the number of showings you get, which then greatly increases your chances of getting a great offer.3. Turning down showing requests. Requests to view your home may not always come at the most convenient time, but the more buyers that we can expose your home to early on, the better the chances we have of presenting you with a great offer early on.If youâre thinking of selling your home, reach out to us.

We had an incredible year with an increase of 20% in our sales from 2017âwe couldnât have done it without you!Moving on, letâs take a look at our latest market numbers for our Northeast Ohio area.7,302 homes sold this year in Summit County compared to 7,948 in 2017, an 8% decrease. Stark County saw 4,296 homes sell, which is a 4% decrease from last yearâs 4,499 sales.Homes sold, on average, in 75 days in Summit County and 68 days in Stark Countyâthere was virtually no change from last yearâs numbers.Homeowners in Summit County received 96% of their original asking price versus 96.5% in Stark Countyâalso no difference from last year.âOur market is still very strong for Northeast Ohio sellers.âWhat we have noticed changing are interest rates. In December 2017, the interest rate was 3.9%. Itâs now at 4.8%, an increase of nearly 1%. Over the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, this 1% means youâll be paying an additional $30,000 in interest.Our market is still very strong for Northeast Ohio sellers. If anything, itâs even stronger than last year, due to fewer homes being sold. Buyers should buy soon to lock in a good interest rate before they rise even furtherâthe Fed plans to raise rates four times in 2019.If youâre considering buying or selling a home, give us a call and letâs get started.

Prepare your home. Homes that have been prepared for the market actually sell for between 5% to 7% more than listings that arenât. In other words, your property should be move-in ready. Our team would be happy to help you with this process. We can guide you toward the changes you should and shouldnât make as you prepare your listing, so that any money spent in the process goes toward bringing you a return. You may be surprised to learn which upgrades and investments are (or arenât) worth making before you list.âYou may be surprised to learn which upgrades and investments are (or arenât) worth making before you list.â2. Order a pre-listing inspection. When you partner with our team, this is something we provide to you at no charge. Essentially, we hire a local inspector to visit your property and check for any structural, mechanical, or safety issues that a buyer might otherwise notice later on in the process. Finding and eliminating these issues before you begin receiving offers will ensure that you remain in control of the deal throughout the transaction. Having a pre-listing inspection could potentially save you thousands.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call, send us an email, or visit www.amysguarantee.com.

Though real estate wasnât exactly what Iâd envisioned for myself from the outset, it quickly became a career that I could never imagine leaving.After leaving my childhood home in Marlington at 18, I spent time in various part-time jobs while living in a trailer. Needless to say, it was during this time I thought to myself: âIâve got to do something.â I wanted to be a surgeon, but weâll just say that didnât work out.Instead, I began talking to someone I knew who worked in real estate. Her pitch about the profession was intriguingâintriguing enough that I quit one of my jobs to work on getting a license. Once I received the license, I left the other job behind as well and began my career as a real estate agent.âIâd be at home showings with children in tow, but thankfully, clients understood my position.âIt wasnât always easy. My husband traveled a lot during the week and weâd begun having children. Iâd be at home showings with children in tow, but thankfully, clients understood my position. Essentially, the kids grew up in the world of real estate.My son Jake is our courier and he drives to houses to put up signs, take measurements, and much more. After growing up surrounded by the many aspects of real estate, he can now become a part of it.We have such a focus on family at Amy Wengerd Realtyâbeing an agent means spending a lot of time with team members, clients, and other agents, and these people become part of our families. Weâre there for each other during the hard days, we share the same goals, and we truly work together as a team.We have 12 agents on our team, and each agent has a specialty. Some are buyerâs specialists, some are sellerâs specialists, and some do everything in between. Itâs important to have a good system like we do, especially because weâve found ourselves selling about a house a day.I had a great time sharing my story on the radio. In the next segment, Iâll be talking about the changes Iâve seen in real estate throughout my 21-year career.If you want to learn more about our team or about real estate in general, donât hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Iâm often asked by homeowners whether they should sell their home in the fall or wait until a later time. Iâve gone over the reasons why fall is a great choice for sellers in this video, and today Iâll be giving you five tips on how to sell your home successfully this season:1. Take advantage of our current market. Weâre still in an extremely strong sellerâs market. Currently, Stark and Summit Counties have 210 pending home sales. 31% of those homes went pending in 14 days or less and 52% were pending in 30 days or less.2. Donât go overboard on improvements. Itâs better to focus on depersonalizing, painting, removing clutter, and adding curb appeal. Weâve found that these changes bring the best return for sellers, so donât worry about upgrading everything you can. Just because you sink a lot of money into a house, it doesnât mean youâll see a return on investment.âWeâre still in an extremely strong sellerâs market.â3. Donât limit showings. If your home looks good online and is priced correctly, youâre going to have a lot of interested buyers. Resist the temptation to turn down showings; excited buyers will go into a bidding frenzy, causing your sale price to rise higher and higher.4. Donât overprice your home. Even though itâs a sellerâs market, you shouldnât price your home too high. It steers buyers away from your home and helps the competition sell instead. Weâve found that overpricing actually nets you less in the long run.5. Donât sell on your own. You may want to save money, but do you have the time for marketing, showing your home, qualifying buyers, handling negotiations, drawing contracts, and closing? We take all of this off your plate as real estate professionals.A commission is a small price to pay for the services a real estate agent provides. We can help you with your buying and selling needs, and want you to reach out to us with any questions you have. We look forward to hearing from you.Â ",

Itâs a good question, as interest rates are the highest theyâve been since May 2011. Let me explain what it means for those who want to purchase a home:This time last year, in the 4th quarter of 2017, the principal and interest payment on a $150,000 home was $760. Now, with those interest rates at 5%, the same payment would be $810. Thatâs a $50 increase in a very short period of time.âIf youâre considering purchasing a home in the near future, we need to talk.âIâll say this: If youâre considering purchasing a home in the near future, we need to talk right away to help you find the most home for your money.

        "content": "Here are the top three reasons this fall is a great opportunity to sell your home.First, buyers are more serious. Many buyers who have children want to locate and move into their new home before school starts. Although that time has already passed, not every family was able to find the right home. There are still many out there who need a home to buy. Not only that, but some buyers who donât have children specifically wait for this time of year to begin their home search. There are fewer buyers out there and less competition, which can be very appealing to those who donât have a strict deadline. Donât forgetâeven though weâre in Ohio, we still have a couple months of warm weather left.Second, thereâs less competition. Now that weâve gotten through the typically busy seller months, there are fewer homes for buyers to choose from, which will make your home more appealing and help you earn top dollar.âDonât worry if we sell your home too quicklyâthat usually means youâve got a price youâre very happy with.âThird, there are different buyer demographics. Many empty-nesters and millennials wait to make their move in the fall to avoid the higher on-season real estate rates. Not only that, but companies looking to relocate their employees will do so in the fall when the market tends to cool down. These out-of-towners typically need to get through the home buying process quickly, which can mean a speedy closing for you. Donât worry if we sell your home too quicklyâthat usually means youâve got a price youâre very happy with.

The first thing you should do is call us so we can guide you through every step of the way. There are also some things you can avoid to make sure you get top dollar for your home whenever you do sell. Here are six buyer pet peeves you need to steer clear of:1. Damp patches or stains on the walls or ceilings. 75% of buyers are put off by this. Go through the house, look up, and make sure there are no indications of these ossies. If you do have them, find out whatâs causing them and get it fixed.2. Unpleasant odors. 56% of buyers are turned off by various odors. They can come from pets, dampness, or even teenagers.3. Dull light. 54% of buyers mention dull light as a turn-off. Itâs important to showcase your house and show it in its best light, both literally and figuratively. Itâs all about that emotion and feeling that buyers have when they walk into your house. We want them to feel great and feel invited.âDecluttering helps make the home look as spacious as possible.â4. Cluttered rooms. This will disappoint another 15% of buyers. We all have clutter, but when itâs time to sell, itâs important to declutter to make the home look as roomy and spacious as possible. This will not only help with photographs, but it will also help with buyers visualizing how they will live there.5. Over-the-top-decor. Less is more, folks. I get it. You want to have all of your collectibles out, but save those for the new house. The selling process should be clear of valuables, not only to minimize the risk to your items, but to show off the space in the home better.6. Outdated bathrooms. This is unappealing to 25% of buyers, but there are some quick fixes you can make. Repainting, fresh new lighting, new plumbing fixtures, and fresh soap on the counter can make the space feel new without the need to remodel.If you have any more questions for us or want any more tips about how to prepare your home for sale, donât hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.

Painting is inexpensive and you have the option of doing it yourself or hiring someone else to do it. With this simple act, you can make it feel as though you live in a brand-new house.Â 2. Add new lighting and plumbing fixtures. There are many great finds in your local hardware store and boutiques. Add a fun chandelier over your bathtub or switch out a kitchen plumbing fixture for something fun. Youâll love how much of a difference those will make for a fairly low cost.Â 3. Add new landscaping. This will help any house look fresh and new. If your plants have been in your yard for a long time, it might be time to pull them out and replace them with something new, boosting your curb appeal.Â 4. Add a deck or patio. Since itâs summer here, you might want to spend a lot of time outside. By adding a deck or patio, you can make that easy, fun, and relaxing. Add a water feature like a fountain, put in a fire pit, and/or add some new lighting to make nighttime engagements more fun. It will also make entertaining guests more enjoyable.Â 5. Spruce up your basement. When weâre not outside, as in the cold months, we tend to spend a lot of time in the basement. Basements also tend to serve as fun areas to entertain, to set up a home gym, to install a home theater, or a wine room.

Oftentimes, we list homes that are sold the very same day. This is great news for our seller clients because it means they are getting top dollar. However, it can also be stressful because they may not have anywhere to go. Â If your home does sell too quickly, there are four solutions that can help you.First, you can negotiate extra possession time in the home with the new buyer. In this scenario, you would pay rent to the buyer to stay in the home after itâs sold long enough for you to find a new home. If this is an option for the new buyer, it can be a great option for you because it prevents you from having to move twice.There are many available properties out there that are vacant, so you can also close on one of those homes and move right in after you sell your current home.âWe handle this situation on a case-by-case basis and come up with the best possible solution for our sellerâs needs.âIf you only need a few weeks to find and close on a new home, you can stay in a hotel and store your things in a storage unit. We have discounts for short-term hotel stays and short-term storage use that all of our sellers can take advantage of. We have negotiated special terms with local hotels that can accommodate our sellersâ needs, plus additional discounts for storage units and moving companies.Lastly, you can stay in a rental property. We have a property manager in our office who manages hundreds of homes for rent at any given time. Some of these homes are available for a short-term rent, which gives our sellers time to find the perfect home to buy without feeling pressured.The bottom line is we handle this situation on a case-by-case basis and come up with the best possible solution for our sellerâs needs.If youâre thinking of selling but this concern has kept you from following through, give us a call so we can find the best possible solution for you.

Here are five signs you should watch out for that mean youâre about to buy something you canât afford:1. There are creative mortgage terms in your loan. If the conditions of your financing look like a trail mix of mortgages and involve terms like âinterest only,â âballoon payment,â âsecond mortgage,â or âadjustable rate,â thatâs a significant indicator that you canât afford the home youâre looking to buy.2. Youâre relying on down payment assistance programs. These can be helpful if used properly. However, if youâre not prepared for the financial aspects of purchasing and owning a home, moving into one before youâre ready, or moving into one you canât afford without the assistance, will do more harm than good.âNo matter what anyone else says, trust your gut.â3. You have just enough to cover the monthly mortgage payment. There will always be additional expenses to owning a home, so you want to have extra money set aside for any surprises that might pop up.4. Youâre borrowing from a retirement account.5. You have a sinking feeling. We always say that no matter what anyone else says, trust your gut.

This can create a lot of frustration for buyers who continually encounter multiple offer situations in the market.That said, there are ways to effectively compete against other homebuyers. Today Iâd like to highlight five key tips you can use to increase your chances of winning in a multiple offer situation.1. Know the market. Being knowledgeable about current trends will help you discern whether a home is priced fairly and make an offer accordingly. Price is one of the most vital aspects of an offer in the sellerâs eyes.2. Inspect the home on your terms. Remember, the inspection period is your time to have the property fully examined, so you may want to reconsider asking the seller to shoulder the cost of inspections you would like to have done.âIt usually benefits the seller to close as soon as possible, so be careful doing anything that will delay this process.â3. Use an escalation clause. This is a strategy my team has been using for years, and it has helped numerous buyers secure a home. An escalation clause allows us to place a cap on the amount you want to pay for a home while also making sure that you arenât overpaying.4. Donât set an extended close date. It usually benefits the seller to close as soon as possible, so be careful doing anything that will delay this process.5. Get a pre-approval letter from a reputable lender. This will help you stand out from competing buyers.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Do you know what could sabotage your home sale? Today I want to talk about the nine silly things that could hurt your ability to sell your home.1. Cords hanging from your mounted television.2. A unkempt yard. Curb appeal is a real thing, which is why we encourage our buyers to drive by any home theyâre interested in before we schedule a showing for that home. If your yard is not mowed and is full of weeds, that can send a strong message to the buyer about the inside of the home.3. A dingy front door. On average, it takes a Realtor about 30 seconds to retrieve the key and unlock the door to your home. During that time, the buyer is taking it all in. Painting your front door and adding a wreath, a welcome mat, or a pot of flowers can go a long way in sending a welcoming message to buyers.âIt is the little things that make the biggest differences for homeowners.â4. Not cleaning up after your pets. We all love our pets, but many buyers have pet allergies. And, it is a big turn-off when the buyer can smell your petâs odor.5. Cobwebs.6. Poor furniture arrangement. You want to show off your home and make it appear large and inviting. That way, buyers can easily picture their furniture in the home.7. Junk drawers and crammed cabinets.8. Overfilled closets. We all have lots of stuff, but when a buyer is viewing your home, they want to make sure there is plenty of room for their things. If closets are overpacked, it sends a message that there will not be room for their items.9. Cluttered countertops. Similar to the closets, you want a buyer to feel that they have plenty of space to cook and entertain. The kitchen is one of the most important rooms in the house.It is the little things that make the biggest differences for homeowners. This is why we give all our clients a thorough consultation, information about stagers, storage unit discounts, cleaning discounts, etc., to help you bring in more money for your home.If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help.",
