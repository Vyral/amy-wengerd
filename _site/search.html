        "content": "Why rising interest rates are a good thing for our real estate market.Interest rates, interest rates, interest rates. It’s all we hear in the news, but we shouldn’t be surprised. Rising interest rates will affect our market, but that is actually a good thing. Why is that?If you’ve been watching these videos for a while, you’ll know that this is what we wanted to happen. We wanted the market to stabilize and become more balanced for buyers and sellers. Interest rates had to rise for this to happen, and of course, they’ll help lower inflation too.Right now, Interest rates are above 6%, but keep in mind that the average historical rate on 30-year fixed mortgages is around 8%. Our current rate is still well below the average, but the increase has caused some buyers to drop out of that market. That’s okay! Some of these buyers probably shouldn’t have been in the market. They were stretching too much and liquidating investments to the point where we didn’t think buying was in their best interest. Another thing that’s happening in our market is that sellers might not be listing their homes, so we still have low inventory. Fewer buyers and fewer homes mean that we’re already starting to see a more balanced market.“This more balanced market is exactly what we needed. ”I was comparing interest rates to gas the other day. We might fill up our cars one day, notice that the price dropped three days later, and say that we should have waited. Lots of people feel the same about interest rates, but the difference is that you can refinance your mortgage. If you get locked in at a higher rate, they will drop at some point, and you can refinance.Things are changing in our market, but maybe not as much as you think. Over the weekend, I listed a home for $725,000. It sold on day one for over the asking price and with great terms. Houses are still moving, there is still tons of demand, and sellers are still getting great offers.If you have any questions about our market or real estate in general, feel free to call or email me. I would love to help.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Two situations that show the difference between the old and new markets.Today we have an important message for anyone looking to buy or sell in our market. The current market is very different from the one we had three to six months ago. We want to paint a picture of what’s going on by comparing the past to the present—we think you’ll find the comparison interesting.Three to six months ago, a $200,000 house might sell for $235,000. Interest rates were about 3.5% back then. The buyer in this first situation waived all their inspections, offered a $5,000 appraisal gap, and paid $5,000 toward the seller’s closing costs. They let the sellers stay in the home for 60 days after closing and take the new fridge that they just bought. The buyer closed in 27 days, which is a quick turnaround. Their offer gets accepted, and their new monthly payment is $1,428 per month. Interest rates have risen in our current market, but what about everything else? In the second scenario, the buyers buy the same $200,000 house. They pay $210,000 instead of $235,000, but they’ll have a higher interest rate of 5.5%. They feel like the home will appraise, so they don’t offer gap coverage. They do an inspection for informational purposes only, and each side pays their own closing costs. They close in the typical 40 days and give the seller only 10 days to vacate their home. Their monthly payment is $1,538.Yes, that monthly payment is $110 more than what the buyer got, but pay attention to everything else: The second buyer didn’t pay for an appraisal gap or cover any seller closing costs, so they have $10,000 more than the first buyer. Let’s say the second buyer takes $6,000 of that extra money and uses it to buy down their interest rate to 4.65%. That makes their monthly payment $1,440, which is only $12 more than it was for the first buyer.“Don’t let higher interest rates scare you away from buying or selling.”On top of that, they used the $4,000 leftover to cover the costs of future home improvements that every buyer needs. They saved an extra monthly payment by not letting the sellers stay so long after closing, and they also kept that new fridge, saving the buyer $1,800. Their inspection also found mold in the attic, and the sellers decided to take care of that mold since they would have to disclose it anyway if they put the home back on the market, saving another $1,200.In total, the second buyer saved about $33,000. The sellers are also happy in both situations because they got more than the asking price in a very short time. Additionally, there is more inventory in our market now, so the sellers in the second situation would have an easier time finding their new house.We’ve been wanting this market to balance out for months, and now we’re starting to see signs of that. Don’t let higher interest rates scare you away from buying or selling. We are still making great deals every day.These situations are obviously hypothetical, but they are very true to what we’re seeing today. If you want to buy, sell, or do both, please call or email us. We would love to help you make a plan to achieve your real estate goals. ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Anxious about buying a home in today’s market? We can help you save money.We’re definitely feeling the spring market here at the Amy Wengerd Group, and it’s so exciting. I’m sure you’ve heard about all the offers that homes for sale are receiving and the terms that are being negotiated. Some homes are selling for 20% or even 30% over asking price! Buyers are even offering to pay for the seller’s closing costs, and many are willing to bridge the gap if the appraisal comes in lower than the asking price. Buyers are willing to do almost anything to secure a house in our market.While we have to educate our buyers that this is what they’re up against, something feels wrong about telling them that they have to pay that much more than the asking price to win a home. After all, we are concerned about our buyers’ futures, and nobody can predict with certainty what’s going to happen down the road.“Year to date, we have saved our buyers $137,800 on the asking prices of the homes they purchased.”That’s why we’re committed to educating you about the market and providing you with every possible option to secure your next purchase. Armed with this knowledge, you can then make an informed decision about whether you want to buy in this market or not. If you don’t want to buy in this market, we’d totally understand. It might be better in some situations to put the home purchase on hold until the market cools down some.However, I do want to offer a ray of hope to all the homebuyers out there. Year to date, we have saved our buyers $137,800 on the asking price of the homes they have purchased. That’s huge, especially considering that number is only over a 3.5-month period. Our buyers went through the whole process, did their inspections, and didn’t all have to pay way more than asking price for their homes. In one case, a buyer paid $20,000 under asking price!If you’re looking to buy a home, know that there are options available to you. We help people overcome obstacles every day, and we’d love to help you, too. Don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email if you have any questions or need assistance with your home purchase. We hope to hear from you soon.",

        "content": "Here’s what we’re doing to combat the rise of waived home inspections.As you know, waiving the home inspection has become more common in real estate transactions these days. With so many buyers competing for each property, this is one strategy they’re using to win.However, it’s also creating some problems. If buyers move in and they find issues, many of them want the previous homeowner to help pay for the fixes. It would be nice if the world worked like that, but it doesn’t. When you waive your inspection, the liability falls on you. To combat this, I’ve started a program to help both sides of the transaction. For our sellers, I’m paying for a pre-listing home inspection that covers just the major areas of the house. I’m talking about looking at the electrical, plumbing, roof, and other major systems in a home that can cause problems. Then our sellers can make that information available to buyers. It prevents the buyer from being caught off guard by issues and even allows our sellers to fix those issues before listing their homes and possibly get a higher price as a result.“It prevents the buyer from being caught off guard by any major issues.”What does this do for buyers? It lets them waive their inspections with confidence. You’ll be aware of any problems upfront, and the inspection report will be disclosed. You won’t be caught off guard by any major surprises once you move in.I am constantly looking for ways to help our clients on both sides of the transaction get through this hectic market. If you have any questions about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

At this same time last month, it was 3.68%. 4.19% is still a phenomenal rate, but they are on the rise. Honestly, rates have been unrealistically low for over 20 years now. “My advice is to find a home soon and get locked in. ”Rising rates could help us balance out this seller’s market. Otherwise, buyers who were already approved at the top of their price point won’t be able to compete, especially with the multiple offers and the higher sale prices that are happening right now.My advice is to find a home soon and get locked in. In the last seven days in Stark and Summit counties, 25 homes that were previously pending and under contract are now back on the market. This could possibly be a great way to find a motivated seller. This is just one of the ways that I help my buyers navigate this market and successfully purchase a home without breaking the bank. Contact me by phone or email to set up a private meeting where we can strategize and come up with the best way to put you in your new home.

That’s not always the case; there are a lot of pitfalls and obstacles even with contracts between professionals, let alone when you do it by yourself. That’s why we’re here to help.For buyers, we can represent you in a FSBO sale. We can work with the homeowners, negotiate the commission, and work it all out so that you have representation. The seller can still represent themselves in the transaction too.“We can be flexible with FSBO buyers and sellers.”We have options for sellers, too. We can offer a free open house where one of our buyer agents will hold your house open, and if they secure a buyer, they will represent that buyer. You can still represent yourself. We also provide discounted professional photography and a free front picture of your house. We can even give you the state-required forms if you need them. Our team of 14 buyer agents would love to take a tour of your home and see if they have any buyers who would be interested. We understand the temptation of listing FSBO, and we can be flexible with you. We want to be a resource for you, and we want to help out buyer clients if they are interested in a FSBO home.

        "content": "Here’s where I advise home sellers to spend their money before listing.We’ve been receiving a ton of calls from homeowners lately who are interested in listing their homes this spring. They want to know what they should add or upgrade in their homes before they sell. Many think they need a full kitchen or basement remodel to get the best return on investment. Most of the time, what they should actually focus on surprises them. Today I’ll go over some of the easy things you can do to get the best possible return.Most times when we meet with homeowners and evaluate their houses, we don’t need to do the majority of things the sellers think they need to do. We’ve found that just cleaning the carpets will get a great ROI. Touching up your paint is an inexpensive fix, too. You might just need to re-paint a room or two.“You’re going to move anyway, so you might as well pack up a bit early.”Decluttering is another great tip. We all accumulate stuff over the years that we like to hang onto, but the more you can pack away while you’re selling your home, the better. The best way to get the best pictures of your property is to declutter your rooms to help them look better for photos. You’re going to move anyway, so you might as well start a little early.Curb appeal is another area of focus that brings a great return on investment. A pop of color here and fresh mulch there can have a huge impact on how buyers perceive your property.My main point for today is that you don’t have to necessarily make those large, expensive upgrades and finishes to get the best return on your investment. There are lots of things you can do to make your home appealing and increase your sale price without breaking the bank. It’s a service that we’re happy to provide here at The Amy Wengerd Group. If you have any questions for me about selling your home or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email.

What does that mean, and do we really do it? I wanted to share a recent story with you so you understand what we do here and what makes us so different.We were working with a couple who wanted to purchase their dream home. They wanted something bigger and closer to their work, but they had to sell their old home first. We made a contingent offer on their dream home, and even though we’re in a seller’s market, the seller agreed to our offer. However, that meant we had to sell my clients’ home fast.“We didn’t want to see them lose their dream home.”They prepped the home beautifully; we must have had 40 showings before they accepted an offer. We weren’t hearing great things from the buyer’s lender, and sure enough, their financing fell through, ending the contract. Our clients were in trouble of losing their dream home, so we stepped in and bought their old house.We closed on their house in eight days, which let them close on their dream home in time. This isn’t typically how we do it, but it needed to be done. Our clients did everything right, so we didn’t want to see them lose their dream home. Thankfully, because of our experience and marketing, we don’t usually have to buy our client’s homes, but if we need to, we will.

Even though the fall is typically a slower season, this September has been the busiest month the Amy Wengerd Group has ever had. None of this would be possible without you, so I plan to continue to bring you the best service possible. Now, onto the market. For days on market, the average in Stark County was 27 days. In the last 14 days in Stark County, 167 homes have been sold. Of those 167 sales, 62 sold over asking price. If 32% of homes sold over asking price, that means we’re still in a strong seller’s market.“If you list your home reasonably, attention from buyers will naturally increase the price.”Meanwhile, in Summit County, there were 292 homes sold in the last 14 days. Of those 292, 136 sold over asking price. Also, the average days on market was 25. When 47% of homes are selling over asking price, that means there are great opportunities for both buyers and sellers. One thing I’ve noticed with pricing is that you can’t copy and paste what a similar home recently sold for. If you list at the final, escalated price, you won’t receive as much attention from buyers. If you list your home reasonably, attention from buyers will naturally increase the price. If you list your home high, it will still sell, but you might not get the best deal possible. If you have any questions about where the market is at or anything else, please reach out to me via phone or email.

If you saw my last blog post, you know we’ve been watching the market shift a bit. We’re seeing houses sit on the market a little longer, and I’ve been watching that the past three weeks to see if it continued. Though historically, August is a slower month because parents are preparing for kids to go back to school, so we don’t get as many listings, a shift is still occurring.As of the recording of this video, 69 homes are pending in Stark and Summit Counties. On average, those houses sat on the market for 18 days before going under contract, much more than in the past few months. That solidifies the market shift we’ve been noticing. “Now’s the time for FHA and VA buyers who didn’t seem to stand a chance earlier in the year.”If you’re a buyer who put your home search on hold because you didn’t want to deal with the type of market we were in, now is the time to act. Now’s the time for FHA and VA buyers who didn’t seem to stand a chance earlier in the year. If you heard that buyers were paying 10% to 20% over the asking price and it scared you, now is a better time. For sellers, all this means you need to be careful about your initial asking price. Even in the most popular areas where everyone wants to buy, if a house is not priced correctly, it just sits. Pricing properly and having a marketing plan are crucial. If your house doesn’t sell within the first two weeks, you need a plan for how to still get the most money in this shifting market. We always want to share the latest information so you can make informed choices.

Today’s message is a public service announcement for anyone thinking of buying a home or already in the middle of the home-buying process. You may have heard about the topic of waiving all of your home inspections. This is a tough subject because, as everyone knows, we’re in a seller’s market. Buyers are coming up with very creative ways to make their offers stand out and entice sellers to work with them. What’s one of the easiest ways to make your offer appeal to a seller? Waive the home inspections! Obviously, we understand that this is appealing to sellers, and my team and I tell our clients that they might be up against other buyers who’re waving their inspections. It’s a tough thing to compete against unless you’re also waiving your inspections. A word of caution, though: A house is likely the largest investment you’ll ever make. Even if you decide to waive inspections, you can’t rely 100% on the property disclosure that the homeowner(s) filled out. They might have forgotten about something or didn’t answer something honestly. You can’t know for sure, so you can’t assume all of the boxes on the form are checked ‘no’ and there aren’t any problems with the house. We’re still brainstorming ways to help our clients obtain the houses they want and compete in multiple-offer situations while also protecting them and ensuring that they know:  What type of house they’re buying  What to expect when they move in  How the systems operate  Every other piece of valuable information you normally get from a home inspector“A house is likely the largest purchase you’ll ever make, so make sure you’ll be happy with it when you move in and for years to come.”We’re also brainstorming ways to help our seller clients with this type of situation. If you’re a seller, you might think it’s great that your buyer is waiving all of their inspections, but after they move in, who do you think they’ll seek out the instant something goes wrong? That’s right: the former homeowner. It’s a crazy market out there, and we’re all doing our best to navigate it. Remember to be careful and use your best judgment. Again, a house is likely the largest purchase you’ll ever make, so make sure you’ll be happy with it when you move in and for years to come. As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.

        "title": "How To Make Your Offer Stand Out Among the Rest",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are three tips for better offers in multiple-offer situations.Many buyers are getting used to the fact that they are stepping into a multiple-offer situation every time they write an offer.  It’s simply the reality of the market we’re in right now.  Though I can’t say when, the market will eventually balance out, but until then, here are three things to consider when you are in a multiple-offer situation.“Sellers are sometimes afraid of an overly inflated price.”1. Your deposit. In Ohio, deposits aren’t super high. I’ve seen other states where the deposit can be as much as 10% of the purchase price. In Ohio, I’ve seen $500 to $1,000. It’s a great area where you can make your offer stand out to sellers. If you go to $2,500, this is going to let the seller know you have no intention of backing out of this offer. The larger that deposit, the more you are telling that seller that you are serious about purchasing their house and sticking with it till closing. Keep in mind that your deposit comes back to you at closing, so it just comes off the total amount that you have to bring anyway.2. The price. Sellers are sometimes afraid of an overly inflated price, fearing that their homes will never appraise for that amount. They’re also nervous that buyers are just willing to say whatever number in order to secure that deal. I just had a multiple-offer situation this past weekend where we had 11 offers on a property and the homeowners ended up choosing an offer that was $15,000 less than the highest offer because they felt that was closer to where it should be priced and that they wouldn’t have any appraisal issues at that lower price.3. Your lender. Out-of-state lenders may not understand our market, so they may give sellers poor advice or leave them with unanswered questions. There are so many great local lenders here who specialize in mortgages, so it’s a safer bet to work with one. Doing so will make your offer stand out, especially if it’s up against somebody else that nobody here recognizes.I know this market is super crazy right now. Reach out to us if you need anything at all, whether you’re selling a house, buying a house, or investing. We look forward to speaking with you. Have a great day.",

        "content": "If you need to buy and sell in this market, I have a solution for you.How can my team’s new home trade-in program help you?If you’re looking to purchase a new home but have to sell your current home too, you have the option of making an offer on a home you like, but that offer will be contingent on your current home selling first. In this seller’s market, sellers are generally being presented with anywhere from 20 to 30 offers after listing. If one of those offers is dependent upon another house selling (that isn’t even on the market yet), they’ll probably accept a different one from the myriad of other buyers who’ve already sold their current homes. You can also put your home on the market now, sell it, and then look for your next home. The problem, though, is that makes you a buyer in a seller’s market. We’re seeing buyers take longer to secure their new homes because, as I mentioned, they’re competing with 20 to 30 other offers at a time. We’ve heard of people in this situation staying in campers, with relatives, or in extended-stay hotels because they can’t quite get into their next home yet or the process is taking longer than they thought.“The expenses, stress, and hassle of making a double move aren’t fun.”The expenses, stress, and hassle of making a double move aren’t fun. Moving once is painful enough. Moving twice is doubly painful.That’s why my team and I created this program. Go to our website, click on “List With Us,” give us your information, and we’ll call you right away to schedule a consultation where we’ll discuss all of your selling options. If you decide that our home trade-in program makes the most sense, we’ll buy your current home from you. You’ll be able to close quickly and free up all that equity so you can make an offer on your new home without any contingencies. Also, get this: After you secure your new home, we’ll let you stay in your old home for up to 90 days so that you don’t have to make that costly, stressful double move. We’ve been watching this seller’s market, and there are a lot of good things happening, but some unfortunate things are happening as well. If this home trade-in program can help just one person not have to make a double move and undergo what others have had to undergo, that’s what my team and I will do. If you have questions about this program or are interested in taking advantage of it, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to hear from you.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here’s why you don’t need to worry about an impending market crash.Along with the spring real estate market comes questions from both buyers and sellers about the current market we’re in and if this market could crash like the one in 2007 did. In my opinion, the answer is no. This market isn’t the same environment that led up to the 2007 crash. Prices are high right now due to simple supply and demand. We have more buyers than homes for sale; competition and demand are very high, which will all translate to higher prices in any industry. However, one of the biggest differences in this market is our lending practices. From 2003 to 2006, lenders were granting loans that shouldn’t have been made.“This market isn’t the same environment that led up to the 2007 crash.”For example, stated income loans were given when a buyer would simply tell the bank how much money they made, nothing was verified, and they were given a loan. That sounds a bit crazy because it sets people up for failure. Also, lenders were putting people into houses with adjustable-rate mortgages. So the borrower may have been able to make the payment that day, but a year later when the payment was much higher, they weren’t able to make their payments. Those types of sub-standard loans no longer exist. So yes, prices are high these days, but the people buying properties are qualified to sustain those payments, which is a massive difference between the two markets in question. Think about this question for a moment: Would you rather buy a home in a market where prices are increasing or decreasing? Your initial answer might be that you want to buy when prices are lower. However, we want our houses to be worth more than what we paid for them. If you were looking for a property last year but didn’t buy, prices are higher today; if you wait even longer, prices will be even higher yet. If you buy in a buyer’s market when prices are low or falling, your home won’t be worth as much because home values are declining. You want to buy in a market where home values are trending upward. All of this is to say that now is still a wonderful time to buy and sell! Don’t worry, we have options for all those homeowners out there who are worried about selling and not having anywhere to go afterward. We have options that mean you don’t have to move twice, and you can make an offer on a new house without selling your current one first.Call or email us if you’re ready to begin the process of selling your property or buying one. We have you covered either way. We would love to be your real estate experts!",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are the main things that matter to sellers when choosing an offer.Is there anything more important to a seller than the buyer’s price? In the current world of multiple offers, what makes the seller choose certain offers over others? Here are the top four things besides price that sellers consider when choosing an offer:1. Deposit (earnest money). In Ohio, this amount has always been minimal—it’s not uncommon to get a $1,000 deposit on a $250,000 home. However, sellers are now leaning toward offers with higher deposits because it shows them the buyer is serious and less likely to back out of the deal. In other states, the deposit can be as much as 10% of the sales price!“You only have the pages of the contract to tell your story and prove you’re serious.”2. Type of financing. If the house needs fresh paint or other items an appraiser may flag, the seller is much more likely to choose a cash or conventional offer. These buyers often come with fewer repair requests and surprises. If you’re getting a loan, check with your loan officer to see if you’re able to secure conventional financing.3. Down payment. Frequently, the down payment line is left blank, which leaves the seller wondering if the buyer is financially strong. We always recommend that buyers indicate the amount they’re putting down, especially if they’re putting down 10% or more.4. Inspections. This is a sensitive topic; we will never tell our buyers not to inspect a property, but we do feel obligated to tell them that they’ll probably be competing with others who have waived inspections or are doing them just for information, not to request repairs. Put yourself in the seller’s shoes: Would you rather accept an offer with four possible inspections or one that has waived them all? Bottom line: As a buyer, you only have the pages of the contract to tell your story and prove you’re serious to the seller. We cover eight additional items with our buyers to ensure their offers stand out from the rest. If you’re considering buying or selling or have any questions, please reach out to us via phone or email.

Due to the lack of inventory and strong buyer demand, home prices have substantially increased in our area. This is a great opportunity for sellers, but they should avoid one main pitfall.“Setting your house’s price too high helps to sell other properties on the market.”One service we provide is informing sellers of their home’s value by evaluating recent market data and comparing their houses to others that are for sale or have sold recently. We can then establish a price range for the property with which the seller is comfortable. However, some sellers want to push the market and raise their asking price. Occasionally that works, but often buyers and their agents realize the price is too high and choose to purchase another home. Setting your house’s price too high helps to sell other properties on the market, which is not what we want. If we price your home aggressively without overpricing it, we can get you multiple offers, which drives up the price due to buyers competing for it. This is why you should hire a Realtor to help sell your house; we will thoroughly go over all the different strategies and find the one you’re most comfortable with that also helps achieve your goals. Call or email us today for a free consultation or if you have any questions about pricing your property or real estate in general.

        "content": "Here are the three options you have if the appraisal comes in low.It’s difficult to believe we’re already this far into 2021, but all signs point to another seller’s market this year. With sellers continuing to benefit from low inventory, many buyers are paying way over asking price just to secure the home. However, what happens when the appraiser comes out to the property and finds the value of the home to be lower than the sales price? Here are the three options we have for when this situation arises:1. Request a copy of the appraisal. Appraisers are human, just like the rest of us, and sometimes mistakes are made. So we first verify the appraisal to ensure all the house’s information is correct.“This is yet another reason to have competent representation.”2. Submit a rebuttal. If all the information is accurate, then we can rebut the appraisal with the lender involved by supplying updated information about the property and any other comparable home sales that we feel will help justify a higher sales price. It can be challenging to get the appraiser to change their assessment, but we’ve done it successfully. 3. Ask the seller to adjust their price. If the other options have been exhausted, the buyer can ask the seller to lower their price to the appraised value. The homeowner isn’t required to do this, though, and will sometimes only consider this option if your contract says that the sale is contingent upon a satisfactory appraisal or the buyer’s loan won’t get approved based on the lower appraised value. All of this is to say that we have options if we’re faced with a low appraisal. This is just another reason to have competent representation whether you’re a buyer or seller. Call or email us if you have further questions about low appraisals or any other real estate matter.

So today I’m providing a recap of the Stark and Summit County real estate markets by comparing 2019 to 2020. In Stark County from January 1, 2019, through the end of November 2019, the average sale price was $140,000, homes took an average of 36 days to sell, and sellers received 97.6% of their asking price. During that same stretch of 2020, the average sale price was $157,000, which is a 12% increase. Houses took an average of 29 days to sell, and sellers received 99% of their asking price. If you’re in Stark County, it’s fair to assume that your property could be worth 12% more this year than last. “We’ve experienced an average value increase of approximately 10% for our properties.”In 2019, the average sale price for Summit County was $147,000, homes took an average of 42 days to sell, and sellers received 97% of their asking price. In 2020, the average sale price was $161,125, which is about a 9% increase.In both counties, we’ve experienced an average value increase of approximately 10% for our properties. For example, if your home was worth $150,000 in 2019, it could be worth $165,000 here in 2020.

        "content": "Don’t part ways with your hard-earned money; beware of these mistakes.If you’re prepping your home for a sale, here are the top three mistakes you must avoid: 1. Updating any other level aside from the main one. The main level of your house, where the kitchen is located, is by far the most important place to invest your money when selling, so forget about updating the other levels. Of course, if you plan on living in your home for a long time and building equity, then feel free to update any other level that you want to. But for those getting ready to sell, don’t spend tons of money renovating rooms that aren’t on the main level.“Someone will buy your home because they like its location and layout, not because it has a brand-new furnace.”2. Going crazy with interior renovations. We get asked all the time about materials, as in, “Should I install hardwood floors?” Here’s the truth, though: Replacing your carpet and repainting everything a neutral color are the only things you should focus on. Leave everything as it is. Don’t start wainscotting, installing crown molding in the bedrooms, making accent walls, etc. Those things won’t give you a good return on investment. If you want to install flooring, luxury vinyl tile is way less expensive than ceramic and it still looks fantastic. 3. Buying new appliances. If your furnace is old, don’t buy a new one unless your current one actually breaks down. Someone will buy your home because they like its location and layout, not because it has a brand-new furnace. Of course, that’s not to say a new furnace wouldn’t be a nice perk, but it’s definitely not the wisest way to spend your money in preparation of hitting the market. Our team has a warranty plan that we can use to negotiate during inspections should any issues arise regarding the age of any of our homeowners’ appliances. This warranty will cover the buyers for the first 12 months that they live in their house, so again: Don’t fret about your older appliances. If these tips aren’t enough and you just need some more one-on-one advice on selling, that’s perfectly understandable. That’s why we’re here and ready to help. Give us a call or send an email and we will give you a free 20-minute in-home consultation and answer any other questions you may have.

It’s a big deal, and we don’t take it lightly. Here’s an example: Recently, I was showing a house to a couple who wanted to make an offer on it. Based on what other homes in that area had sold for, and given the fact that the school district and neighborhood were particularly popular, fast-growing areas, I’m sure that my buyers would have encountered a multiple-offer situation. “When you’re buying a house, you need solid advice that transcends the market of the moment.”After reviewing the comparable properties and talking on the phone several times, we realized that it wouldn’t be in their best interest to purchase that particular property. The main reason is that the couple was intent on pouring an additional $50,000 into the home for improvements, which by itself is not an issue—there’s nothing wrong with wanting to make a house a home. However, since we’re in a hot seller’s market and this property was already priced very high, that additional $50,000 investment would wreck any hopes of selling for a return in the future. If they were to sell in the next few years, they’d have to price their home way out of the market. When you’re buying a house, you need solid advice that transcends the market of the moment. You need somebody who will go to bat for you and speak the truth, even if it’s not what you want to hear. A good investment is one that remains solid two to three years down the road when the market conditions could look completely different. If you’re currently in the home-buying process or just starting to think about a purchase, we’d be honored to help you.

Not only does the exterior of your home give buyers a hint of the interior’s condition, but it also has a direct impact on the number of showings your home generates. That being said, here are four ways you can improve your curb appeal and help get top dollar for your home:  Power wash. Not only will this bring your home back to life, but it will brighten your driveway and sidewalks as well. You might be surprised at how your home looks after the power wash is done.   Paint the front door. This is what buyers first see, so a fresh coat of paint can make a great first impression.   Add flowers. These add color and character to your house, and it’s another way to show buyers you care about your home and how it looks.   Lay down a doormat. Did you know that when a buyer visits your home, they spend approximately 30 seconds to a full minute on the front porch while their Realtor is unlocking and opening the door? Can you guess what they’re doing during that time? That’s right—they’re checking out the space, including the front door and doormat, and seeing whether any maintenance is needed. If you list with us, we’ll give you a free doormat!

We have a fix for that. Selling your home can be a huge hassle if you absolutely need to sell but don’t have the time, money, or energy required to do it well in the traditional fashion. Luckily, we have a program designed for sellers whose chief priority is to have an accelerated, pain-free process. Here’s how our Fast Forward Program works:   You call our office to see if you qualify.   I figure out your needs. If you do qualify, I’ll come to your house, discern whether there are any repairs that need to be addressed, and learn more about your particular selling circumstances.   I give you an offer for your home. Within 72 hours, you’ll hear back from me with a full-fledged offer—it’s literally that easy. If you accept the offer, we can typically schedule the closing within about two weeks (or we can extend it longer if you need it). You’ll be able to fast-forward through all of the prep work, showings, open houses, inspections, appraisal process, and bank paperwork so you can arrive at the closing table and pocket your check. Not everyone needs the absolute most money out of their home sale; depending on the circumstances (or personal preference), some would rather take a little less money just to have the process completed within a few short weeks. If this sounds like you, give our team a call today or send us an email. Don’t fret; if it turns out this program isn’t the best way to meet your needs, we sell hundreds of homes every year using our award-winning marketing and my 23 years of real estate experience, so we have you covered either way.

We’re observing that they’re taking longer to buy a home than older generations. They may seem eager to buy, but 75% of millennial buyers say they’re overwhelmed by the process of purchasing a house. Younger adults have a lot on their minds. Studies show that millennials have many concerns, from job stability and relationships to the economy and the 2020 election. 47% of millennials say that growing up during the housing crisis has made them anxious about buying a home. This is because more than half say their family or someone they knew lost a house during that period. “A goal without a plan is just a wish.”We get it; this can all be very overwhelming. However, one of my favorite quotes reminds us: “Where there is no risk, there is no reward.” We aren’t saying you should buy a home right away and without a plan. However, I encourage you to start your plan, write down your housing goals, set time frames to meet those goals, and take steps needed to achieve them. Remember: “A goal without a plan is just a wish.”We can provide a private, risk-free consultation to help you compose a plan for buying a house. We can help you figure out how much you can spend on a property. It’s painless and can be done in minutes or even online. Then you can start to get excited about homeownership. We are here for you no matter what stage in the process you’re in.

        "content": "If you&rsquo;re in the market to sell your home, you need to know that all home remodel projects aren&rsquo;t created equal. Here&rsquo;s where you can get the best bang for your buck.  If you’re in the market to sell your home and wondering what you can do before selling to get the highest possible sale price, I have some great advice today. Many homeowners will spend a lot of money on upgrades and improvements that they think homeowners will appreciate, only to find out later that buyers won’t pay extra for it. Here are four things that you should keep in mind when determining what you should do before selling:1. Be cautious about installing a pool in Northeast Ohio. Our pool season, unfortunately, is very short. Homebuyers just aren’t willing to pay dollar for dollar for this improvement. If you’re not going to sell right away and your family loves the pool, then spend away. Just know that if you spend $30,000 on a pool it doesn’t make your home worth $30,000 more.“A small bathroom remodel can be done relatively inexpensively and yield a great return.”2. Consider how long you’re going to live in the house before taking on a big project. For example, if you want to install a gourmet kitchen with all the bells and whistles, you would need to stay in the house for 10-15 years to recoup that investment from an ROI perspective.3. A small bathroom expansion or remodel is one of the best improvements you can make. It can be done relatively inexpensively and yield a great return.4. When it’s time to sell, it’s important to neutralize your colors and return rooms to their intended purposes. If you have an extra bedroom that you use for an office or a gym, we always suggest that you convert that back to a bedroom or whatever its intended use is.If you have other questions about selling a home or anything else related to real estate, feel free to reach out via phone or email.

From 2015 to 2018, the most popular month for looking at online listings was April, with January lagging behind by a full 16%.

We’re here to provide the public with solid advice—whether they use our services or not. That being said, there are a couple of things to consider when making this decision. “Homes appreciate slower in Northeast Ohio than they do in most of the rest of the country.”If you’re going to be in the area you intend to live in for a short period (two years or less), you’re better off renting because homes appreciate slower in Northeast Ohio than they do in most of the rest of the country. Keep in mind, though, that rentals in our area cost an average of $1,200 per month, so if you rent at that rate for three years, you’d lose at least $43,000. Very rarely do homebuyers lose out on $43,000 if they have to sell in three years. Also, if you don’t qualify for a mortgage, finding a practical rental is a great option, too. This will allow you to save money and improve your credit score.You may have other reasons to rent instead of buy, and we’d be more than happy to discuss those with you if you’d like to talk more about this topic.

The average price was $147,000, and the average days on market was 65. For 2019, Stark saw a slight dip in residential sales with 4,400. The average price increased to $160,000, and the average days on market decreased to 60. “Since the number of sales in both counties is down this year, we’re still dealing with low housing inventory.”Last year, Summit County had 7,900 residential sales. The average price was $167,000, and the average days on market was 74. Summit saw a larger dip in residential sales than Stark did (7,200 for 2019), but similarly, the average sale price increased ($175,000) and the average days on market fell to 66. Those are the numbers, but what does this really tell you? Since the number of sales in both counties is down this year, we’re still dealing with low housing inventory. It’s nothing new, though; low inventory has characterized our market for five years now. In turn, means that home values in both counties have increased—9% in Stark and 5% in Summit. The bottom line: If you’re a homeowner wanting to sell, it’s still a great time to do so. Feel free to give us a call or send us an email today so we can help you make the most of the market and achieve your real estate goals.

        "content": "Here are the top five reasons that homebuyers should hire an exclusive buyer specialist to assist them in their purchase. The Amy Wengerd Group has created an exclusive group of buyer specialists who are not only licensed Realtors, but who have also gone through extensive additional training before ever even serving one of our clients. Here are the top five reasons that homebuyers should hire an exclusive buyer specialist:1. Sellers have exclusive representation of their own, so why shouldn’t you as a buyer? The seller has hired and contracted an agent to get them the most money out of their house in any given market. However, as a buyer, you want to get the best deal (i.e., the lowest price) for a home.2. Buyer representation is virtually free. Most agencies will charge a buyer anywhere from $200 to $500 for their services to be paid at closing. The seller always pays the commission of the agent who represents you, so you don’t have to worry about paying a commission. You’ll typically only have to pay a small fee to the brokerage, but the amount of help you receive in return is invaluable.“The seller always pays the commission of the agent who represents you, so you don’t have to worry about paying a commission.”3. You only need to call your buyer specialist when you have a question about a listing. They can answer all of your questions, show you any house, advise you on the market, and so much more. Wouldn’t that be so much easier than clicking through all the different websites and contacting numerous Realtors about all the different properties, waiting for the calls back, and trying to figure out which Realtor called you about which house? It gets a little overwhelming.4. Our buyer clients enjoy certain benefits, like being able to use our moving truck for free and receiving a discount card. Plus, they have a team helping out who make sure the buyers never miss out on the home of their dreams. They’ll also receive invitations to our special events, giveaways, and so much more.5. Year to date, our buyer agents have saved their clients over $543,000 on their home purchases.Contact us today so you can get started. Let us help you make the perfect match with one of our buyer specialists so we can get you into your dream home this year—there’s still plenty of time.",

        "content": "There are three ways you can tell if your home is overpriced.&nbsp; Many homeowners come to us to voice their frustration that their home hasn’t sold, and almost every time, the reason why boils down to overpricing. We at the Amy Wengerd Group always try to get the most money possible for our sellers no matter which market we’re in, and sometimes they prefer to list their house above our suggested price, and that’s fine. But what if you picked an agent with a great reputation and marketing plan and your home still isn’t selling?Here are the three ways to know if your home is overpriced:1. No buyers or Realtors are contacting you about the house. This means no emails, texts, phone calls, etc. “You always want to net the most money possible from your home sale, but you don’t want to sabotage it by pricing your home too high.”2. Your home has showings, but no offers. In this situation, you’ll hear buyers tell you that they’d like to keep looking, or the house just isn’t for them, or they found something they liked better. Usually, this means they liked what they saw online, but they decided the home wasn’t a good value in person. In other words, you’re helping to sell the competition.3. Potential buyers are making lowball offers. This doesn’t mean they want to “steal your house.” They may like it, but feel as though the price doesn’t align with current market conditions. You always want to net the most money possible from your home sale, but you don’t want to sabotage it by pricing your home too high. If you’d like some guidance on how to navigate this tricky process, don’t hesitate to give our team a call.

        "content": "Before you put your home on the market, there are four repairs and upgrades you should make to ensure you earn top dollar.  Making certain upgrades and repairs to your home before you list it is a good idea, in general, but did you know that doing so can also help you earn top dollar? Here are four key projects most likely to bring a high return: 1. Improve and maintain your home’s curb appeal. The way your home looks when buyers pull up to it on the street will serve as their first (in-person) impression, so you need to make sure it’s a good one. Trim trees and bushes, add fresh mulch, and plant a few flowers to get everything looking neat and inviting. 2. Take care of minor repairs you’ve been putting off. If you’ve always meant to touch up your paint or fix that hole in your siding, now is the time to do so. Buyers are going to notice every little thing when they look at your home, so make sure there aren’t many issues for them to find before your home goes live on the market. “Buyers will be able to better envision how they might utilize your home’s space after it’s been decluttered.”3. Declutter. Cluttered homes look smaller and less clean than they may actually be, which can deter buyers. So as you get ready to sell your home, start packing away, selling, or trashing unwanted items. Your home will look much better once you do. Beyond that, buyers will be able to better envision how they might utilize your home’s space. 4. Make sure expensive systems and appliances are functioning properly. The last thing you want is to go under contract only for the buyer to find out your HVAC unit isn’t functioning properly. These are the sort of problems that home inspections are designed to identify, and leaving them unresolved could cost you your deal.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

That’s assuming that all the good houses are available and not flying off the market like they did this last spring.“It could take five months or more from start to finish.”2.Once your offer is accepted, the bank will take approximately 40 days to process and approve your loan.3.The homeowner may ask for additional time to stay in the house after closing. This is negotiable, but it should be something that you account for when you’re calculating your timeline.In the end, it could take four to five months for you to get into your new home when all is said and done.

As it turns out, there are three key reasons why you should engage the services of an experienced inspector before you buy a home:1. You’ll gain a better understanding of your new home. Not only does a home inspector point out issues of concern, but they also answer any and all questions you might have about the systems in the house. Every house is different, so making sure that you have a good understanding of your new home is important.2. They’ll find both current and future issues with the home. A home inspector won’t just find issues that currently beset the property, but they can also tell you which issues are most likely to arise in the future. It’s a really good idea to start a plan for home improvements in the future if you don’t want to be blindsided by costly repairs down the road.“Without the inspector’s report, it’s virtually impossible for us to address any repair issues with the homeowner.”3. Home inspections will allow us to negotiate home repairs with the seller. A great inspector will provide you with a thorough report, complete with pictures and details, within 24 hours of your inspection. Without that report, it’s virtually impossible for us to address any repair issues with the homeowner.No matter what, we want to make sure that our homebuyers have the most information available when undergoing what is likely the largest investment of their lives.

To better understand the market’s state at a given time, many buyers and sellers come to us asking about supply and demand in their particular area. Absorption rate data is divided into area, county, and the townships and cities located within them. Let’s explore how instrumental this data is in serving our clients a little further: Last year in North Canton, there was just a one month’s supply of homes in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range. Fast forward to 2019: We now have a three-month supply of homes in that same price range. With respect to those homes, this points to a slowdown in sales and more inventory from one year to the next.  “By careful comparison and analysis of absorption rate data, we can advise both our buyers and sellers based on the numbers for that particular week.”With all that in mind, we’ll advise our sellers whose home falls within that price point to yield to these conditions and to lean more toward a competitive pricing strategy.As for our buyers, we’ll share the encouraging news that there are more homes available in that price range than there were just a year earlier. We can also show them the data for the $300,000 to $350,000 range and, in this particular case, it only gets better: Inventory jumps from a three-month supply to a 7.5-month supply. All of this is made possible by absorption rate data, and by careful comparison and analysis, we can advise both our buyers and sellers based on the numbers for that particular week. No matter if you’re a buyer or seller, please reach out to us and let us put our experience and expertise to work for you. We hope to hear from you very soon!  ",

        "content": "Perhaps simultaneously buying a new home and selling your current home is an approach that lines up with your real estate goals. If that’s the case, there are three solutions to help you maneuver through the process smoothly: Speak with a reputable lender to learn all your options first. Your lender may reveal that you have enough equity in your current home to extract and use as a down payment on your new home—what’s known as a bridge loan. We have lenders who can help you with this option. If you’re selling first, place a contingency offer on your new home. With this contingency, any purchase you make hinges on the sale of your current home. Until then, you’re not obligated to go through with buying a home. “Your lender may reveal that you have enough equity in your current home to extract and use as a down payment on your new home.”It will also allow us to extend the closing date on your purchase if necessary. Say our original closing date is set for May 25, which would mean your first payment is scheduled for July 1. By extending your closing date to June 1, though, your first payment won’t be due until August 1—that one extra week gives us a much larger window of time to sell your home. Finally, sell your home through our exclusive guaranteed sale program. You’ve heard it on the radio and we’ve said it for years: If we can’t sell your home through the traditional course in 59 days or less, we will buy the home ourselves. You’ll be made aware of the buyout price and any fees up front so you can plan for your next purchase without any uncertainty about your home sale. What if you’re already eyeing a property you love, and you’d like to make a speedy sale? No worries! We can even give you an instant offer on your home, in which you can set the closing date. As you can see, we have just about every situation covered for your specific buyer and seller needs.

If selling for the most is your goal, here are three major mistakes that you should avoid making, lest you risk potentially sabotaging your own sale:1. Setting the wrong price. Overpricing isn’t the only mistake a seller should avoid making; you should also avoid underpricing your home—it may cause them to think that something is wrong with your home. Of course, overpricing can push away buyers who think your home is too expensive. That’s why hiring an experienced agent can save you thousands of dollars and lots of grief.“The more buyers that we can expose your home to early on, the better the chances we have of presenting you with a great offer early on.”2. Failing to prepare your home for sale. One of the first things we have to do when selling your home is list it online to the hundreds of different websites where we market homes. That means it’s very important to spend time decluttering, neutralizing, and revamping your curb appeal to make it look its best when our photographer comes to your home. Great listing photos will increase the number of showings you get, which then greatly increases your chances of getting a great offer.3. Turning down showing requests. Requests to view your home may not always come at the most convenient time, but the more buyers that we can expose your home to early on, the better the chances we have of presenting you with a great offer early on.If you’re thinking of selling your home, reach out to us.

        "content": "I can’t believe we’re almost at the end of 2018! We had an incredible year with an increase of 20% in our sales from 2017—we couldn’t have done it without you!Moving on, let’s take a look at our latest market numbers for our Northeast Ohio area.7,302 homes sold this year in Summit County compared to 7,948 in 2017, an 8% decrease. Stark County saw 4,296 homes sell, which is a 4% decrease from last year’s 4,499 sales.Homes sold, on average, in 75 days in Summit County and 68 days in Stark County—there was virtually no change from last year’s numbers.Homeowners in Summit County received 96% of their original asking price versus 96.5% in Stark County—also no difference from last year.“Our market is still very strong for Northeast Ohio sellers.”What we have noticed changing are interest rates. In December 2017, the interest rate was 3.9%. It’s now at 4.8%, an increase of nearly 1%. Over the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, this 1% means you’ll be paying an additional $30,000 in interest.Our market is still very strong for Northeast Ohio sellers. If anything, it’s even stronger than last year, due to fewer homes being sold. Buyers should buy soon to lock in a good interest rate before they rise even further—the Fed plans to raise rates four times in 2019.If you’re considering buying or selling a home, give us a call and let’s get started. We look forward to helping you!",

Prepare your home. Homes that have been prepared for the market actually sell for between 5% to 7% more than listings that aren’t. In other words, your property should be move-in ready. Our team would be happy to help you with this process. We can guide you toward the changes you should and shouldn’t make as you prepare your listing, so that any money spent in the process goes toward bringing you a return. You may be surprised to learn which upgrades and investments are (or aren’t) worth making before you list.“You may be surprised to learn which upgrades and investments are (or aren’t) worth making before you list.”2. Order a pre-listing inspection. When you partner with our team, this is something we provide to you at no charge. Essentially, we hire a local inspector to visit your property and check for any structural, mechanical, or safety issues that a buyer might otherwise notice later on in the process. Finding and eliminating these issues before you begin receiving offers will ensure that you remain in control of the deal throughout the transaction. Having a pre-listing inspection could potentially save you thousands.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call, send us an email, or visit www.amysguarantee.com.

Though real estate wasn’t exactly what I’d envisioned for myself from the outset, it quickly became a career that I could never imagine leaving.After leaving my childhood home in Marlington at 18, I spent time in various part-time jobs while living in a trailer. Needless to say, it was during this time I thought to myself: “I’ve got to do something.” I wanted to be a surgeon, but we’ll just say that didn’t work out.Instead, I began talking to someone I knew who worked in real estate. Her pitch about the profession was intriguing—intriguing enough that I quit one of my jobs to work on getting a license. Once I received the license, I left the other job behind as well and began my career as a real estate agent.“I’d be at home showings with children in tow, but thankfully, clients understood my position.”It wasn’t always easy. My husband traveled a lot during the week and we’d begun having children. I’d be at home showings with children in tow, but thankfully, clients understood my position. Essentially, the kids grew up in the world of real estate.My son Jake is our courier and he drives to houses to put up signs, take measurements, and much more. After growing up surrounded by the many aspects of real estate, he can now become a part of it.We have such a focus on family at Amy Wengerd Realty—being an agent means spending a lot of time with team members, clients, and other agents, and these people become part of our families. We’re there for each other during the hard days, we share the same goals, and we truly work together as a team.We have 12 agents on our team, and each agent has a specialty. Some are buyer’s specialists, some are seller’s specialists, and some do everything in between. It’s important to have a good system like we do, especially because we’ve found ourselves selling about a house a day.I had a great time sharing my story on the radio. In the next segment, I’ll be talking about the changes I’ve seen in real estate throughout my 21-year career.If you want to learn more about our team or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email today.

        "category": "",
        "content": "I’m often asked by homeowners whether they should sell their home in the fall or wait until a later time. I’ve gone over the reasons why fall is a great choice for sellers in this video, and today I’ll be giving you five tips on how to sell your home successfully this season:1. Take advantage of our current market. We’re still in an extremely strong seller’s market. Currently, Stark and Summit Counties have 210 pending home sales. 31% of those homes went pending in 14 days or less and 52% were pending in 30 days or less.2. Don’t go overboard on improvements. It’s better to focus on depersonalizing, painting, removing clutter, and adding curb appeal. We’ve found that these changes bring the best return for sellers, so don’t worry about upgrading everything you can. Just because you sink a lot of money into a house, it doesn’t mean you’ll see a return on investment.“We’re still in an extremely strong seller’s market.”3. Don’t limit showings. If your home looks good online and is priced correctly, you’re going to have a lot of interested buyers. Resist the temptation to turn down showings; excited buyers will go into a bidding frenzy, causing your sale price to rise higher and higher.4. Don’t overprice your home. Even though it’s a seller’s market, you shouldn’t price your home too high. It steers buyers away from your home and helps the competition sell instead. We’ve found that overpricing actually nets you less in the long run.5. Don’t sell on your own. You may want to save money, but do you have the time for marketing, showing your home, qualifying buyers, handling negotiations, drawing contracts, and closing? We take all of this off your plate as real estate professionals.A commission is a small price to pay for the services a real estate agent provides. We can help you with your buying and selling needs, and want you to reach out to us with any questions you have. We look forward to hearing from you. ",

It’s a good question, as interest rates are the highest they’ve been since May 2011.

Now, with those interest rates at 5%, the same payment would be $810.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are the top three reasons this fall is a great opportunity to sell your home.First, buyers are more serious. Many buyers who have children want to locate and move into their new home before school starts. Although that time has already passed, not every family was able to find the right home. There are still many out there who need a home to buy. Not only that, but some buyers who don’t have children specifically wait for this time of year to begin their home search. There are fewer buyers out there and less competition, which can be very appealing to those who don’t have a strict deadline. Don’t forget—even though we’re in Ohio, we still have a couple months of warm weather left.Second, there’s less competition. Now that we’ve gotten through the typically busy seller months, there are fewer homes for buyers to choose from, which will make your home more appealing and help you earn top dollar.“Don’t worry if we sell your home too quickly—that usually means you’ve got a price you’re very happy with.”Third, there are different buyer demographics. Many empty-nesters and millennials wait to make their move in the fall to avoid the higher on-season real estate rates. Not only that, but companies looking to relocate their employees will do so in the fall when the market tends to cool down. These out-of-towners typically need to get through the home buying process quickly, which can mean a speedy closing for you. Don’t worry if we sell your home too quickly—that usually means you’ve got a price you’re very happy with. We also have lots of options to find you a new home and make everything work out perfectly.If you’d like to get started with selling your home this fall or you have any other real estate needs I can assist you with, please feel free to get in touch with me.

The first thing you should do is call us so we can guide you through every step of the way. There are also some things you can avoid to make sure you get top dollar for your home whenever you do sell. Here are six buyer pet peeves you need to steer clear of:1. Damp patches or stains on the walls or ceilings. 75% of buyers are put off by this. Go through the house, look up, and make sure there are no indications of these ossies. If you do have them, find out what’s causing them and get it fixed.2. Unpleasant odors. 56% of buyers are turned off by various odors. They can come from pets, dampness, or even teenagers.3. Dull light. 54% of buyers mention dull light as a turn-off. It’s important to showcase your house and show it in its best light, both literally and figuratively. It’s all about that emotion and feeling that buyers have when they walk into your house. We want them to feel great and feel invited.“Decluttering helps make the home look as spacious as possible.”4. Cluttered rooms. This will disappoint another 15% of buyers. We all have clutter, but when it’s time to sell, it’s important to declutter to make the home look as roomy and spacious as possible. This will not only help with photographs, but it will also help with buyers visualizing how they will live there.5. Over-the-top-decor. Less is more, folks. I get it. You want to have all of your collectibles out, but save those for the new house. The selling process should be clear of valuables, not only to minimize the risk to your items, but to show off the space in the home better.6. Outdated bathrooms. This is unappealing to 25% of buyers, but there are some quick fixes you can make. Repainting, fresh new lighting, new plumbing fixtures, and fresh soap on the counter can make the space feel new without the need to remodel.If you have any more questions for us or want any more tips about how to prepare your home for sale, don’t hesitate to reach out and give us a call or send us an email.

Painting is inexpensive and you have the option of doing it yourself or hiring someone else to do it. With this simple act, you can make it feel as though you live in a brand-new house. 2. Add new lighting and plumbing fixtures. There are many great finds in your local hardware store and boutiques. Add a fun chandelier over your bathtub or switch out a kitchen plumbing fixture for something fun. You’ll love how much of a difference those will make for a fairly low cost. 3. Add new landscaping. This will help any house look fresh and new. If your plants have been in your yard for a long time, it might be time to pull them out and replace them with something new, boosting your curb appeal. 4. Add a deck or patio. Since it’s summer here, you might want to spend a lot of time outside. By adding a deck or patio, you can make that easy, fun, and relaxing. Add a water feature like a fountain, put in a fire pit, and/or add some new lighting to make nighttime engagements more fun. It will also make entertaining guests more enjoyable. 5. Spruce up your basement. When we’re not outside, as in the cold months, we tend to spend a lot of time in the basement. Basements also tend to serve as fun areas to entertain, to set up a home gym, to install a home theater, or a wine room. A finished basement holds endless opportunity.“A finished basement holds endless opportunity.”In addition to bringing happiness to your life, these improvements can also add value to your home if you ever decide to sell.

Oftentimes, we list homes that are sold the very same day. This is great news for our seller clients because it means they are getting top dollar. However, it can also be stressful because they may not have anywhere to go.  If your home does sell too quickly, there are four solutions that can help you.First, you can negotiate extra possession time in the home with the new buyer. In this scenario, you would pay rent to the buyer to stay in the home after it’s sold long enough for you to find a new home. If this is an option for the new buyer, it can be a great option for you because it prevents you from having to move twice.There are many available properties out there that are vacant, so you can also close on one of those homes and move right in after you sell your current home.“We handle this situation on a case-by-case basis and come up with the best possible solution for our seller’s needs.”If you only need a few weeks to find and close on a new home, you can stay in a hotel and store your things in a storage unit. We have discounts for short-term hotel stays and short-term storage use that all of our sellers can take advantage of. We have negotiated special terms with local hotels that can accommodate our sellers’ needs, plus additional discounts for storage units and moving companies.Lastly, you can stay in a rental property. We have a property manager in our office who manages hundreds of homes for rent at any given time. Some of these homes are available for a short-term rent, which gives our sellers time to find the perfect home to buy without feeling pressured.The bottom line is we handle this situation on a case-by-case basis and come up with the best possible solution for our seller’s needs.If you’re thinking of selling but this concern has kept you from following through, give us a call so we can find the best possible solution for you.

There are creative mortgage terms in your loan. If the conditions of your financing look like a trail mix of mortgages and involve terms like “interest only,” “balloon payment,” “second mortgage,” or “adjustable rate,” that’s a significant indicator that you can’t afford the home you’re looking to buy.2. You’re relying on down payment assistance programs. These can be helpful if used properly. However, if you’re not prepared for the financial aspects of purchasing and owning a home, moving into one before you’re ready, or moving into one you can’t afford without the assistance, will do more harm than good.“No matter what anyone else says, trust your gut.”3. You have just enough to cover the monthly mortgage payment. There will always be additional expenses to owning a home, so you want to have extra money set aside for any surprises that might pop up.4. You’re borrowing from a retirement account.5. You have a sinking feeling. We always say that no matter what anyone else says, trust your gut.

This can create a lot of frustration for buyers who continually encounter multiple offer situations in the market.That said, there are ways to effectively compete against other homebuyers. Today I’d like to highlight five key tips you can use to increase your chances of winning in a multiple offer situation.1. Know the market. Being knowledgeable about current trends will help you discern whether a home is priced fairly and make an offer accordingly. Price is one of the most vital aspects of an offer in the seller’s eyes.2. Inspect the home on your terms. Remember, the inspection period is your time to have the property fully examined, so you may want to reconsider asking the seller to shoulder the cost of inspections you would like to have done.“It usually benefits the seller to close as soon as possible, so be careful doing anything that will delay this process.”3. Use an escalation clause. This is a strategy my team has been using for years, and it has helped numerous buyers secure a home. An escalation clause allows us to place a cap on the amount you want to pay for a home while also making sure that you aren’t overpaying.4. Don’t set an extended close date. It usually benefits the seller to close as soon as possible, so be careful doing anything that will delay this process.5. Get a pre-approval letter from a reputable lender. This will help you stand out from competing buyers.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Cords hanging from your mounted television.2. A unkempt yard. Curb appeal is a real thing, which is why we encourage our buyers to drive by any home they’re interested in before we schedule a showing for that home. If your yard is not mowed and is full of weeds, that can send a strong message to the buyer about the inside of the home.3. A dingy front door. On average, it takes a Realtor about 30 seconds to retrieve the key and unlock the door to your home. During that time, the buyer is taking it all in. Painting your front door and adding a wreath, a welcome mat, or a pot of flowers can go a long way in sending a welcoming message to buyers.“It is the little things that make the biggest differences for homeowners.”4. Not cleaning up after your pets. We all love our pets, but many buyers have pet allergies. And, it is a big turn-off when the buyer can smell your pet’s odor.5. Cobwebs.6. Poor furniture arrangement. You want to show off your home and make it appear large and inviting. That way, buyers can easily picture their furniture in the home.7. Junk drawers and crammed cabinets.8. Overfilled closets. We all have lots of stuff, but when a buyer is viewing your home, they want to make sure there is plenty of room for their things. If closets are overpacked, it sends a message that there will not be room for their items.9. Cluttered countertops. Similar to the closets, you want a buyer to feel that they have plenty of space to cook and entertain. The kitchen is one of the most important rooms in the house.It is the little things that make the biggest differences for homeowners. This is why we give all our clients a thorough consultation, information about stagers, storage unit discounts, cleaning discounts, etc., to help you bring in more money for your home.If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I would be happy to help.",
