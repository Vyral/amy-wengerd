We are noticing a trend with our millennial buyers, which are people currently between the ages of 23 and 38. We’re observing that they’re taking longer to buy a home than older generations. They may seem eager to buy, but **75% of millennial buyers say they’re overwhelmed by the process of purchasing a house.&nbsp;**

Younger adults have a lot on their minds. Studies show that millennials have many concerns, from job stability and relationships to the economy and the 2020 election. 47% of millennials say that growing up during the housing crisis has made them anxious about buying a home. This is because more than half say their family or someone they knew lost a house during that period.&nbsp;

We get it; this can all be very overwhelming. However, one of my favorite quotes reminds us: “Where there is no risk, there is no reward.” We aren’t saying you should buy a home right away and without a plan. However, I encourage you to start your plan, write down your housing goals, set time frames to meet those goals, and take steps needed to achieve them. Remember: “A goal without a plan is just a wish.”

We can provide a private, risk-free consultation to help you compose a plan for buying a house. We can help you figure out how much you can spend on a property. It’s painless and can be done in minutes or even online. Then you can start to get excited about homeownership.&nbsp;

We are here for you no matter what stage in the process you’re in. **Inaction usually comes from fear, but knowledge can often make that fear disappear.&nbsp;**

Please call or email us today to discuss this topic further or if you have any questions. We’re here to help, and we can’t wait to speak with you.&nbsp;
