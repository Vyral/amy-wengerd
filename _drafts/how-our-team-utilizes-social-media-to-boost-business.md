If you haven’t heard by now, “Rambo 5: Last Blood” is coming to theaters in September. Anyone who knows me is aware that I’m a huge fan of Sylvester Stallone’s, and I’m apparently not the only one—the movie is being promoted all over social media.

Speaking of social media: 15 years ago when Facebook started, who would have thought that we’d end up selling homes on Facebook? The internet has changed drastically in a relatively short period of time, and being mindful of your social media presence is key in our business.

**The [Amy Wengerd Group’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/SOLDBYWENGERD/){: target="_blank"} currently has over 2,300 followers, and that number grows every day.** Each year on one of our social media sites, we give away almost $1,000 in prizes, and this doesn’t include all of our past client giveaways and the events that we hold for those past clients. Some of our real estate posts have reached over 20,000 people and have been shared hundreds of times.

We also use [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amywengerdrealestateteam){: target="_blank"} to network with other professionals in the area to help our business grow.

[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/soldbywengerd/){: target="_blank"} works best for our younger buyers and sellers. Here, we recruit, sell homes, post giveaways, share stories, and help our clients harness the power of social media.&nbsp;

**By following us on all our sites, you’ll allow us to help even more people, and hopefully, you’ll win something along the way.**

If you have any questions about utilizing social media to empower your business, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I'd be happy to speak with you.
