{% include youtube.html %}Whether you’re an investor or a homeowner, our Fast Forward Program may be perfect for you. Here’s why.&nbsp;

Investors and homeowners, take note: My team is having so much success that we want to remind you once more about the newest program we’re offering to you. It’s called the Fast Forward Program, and we’ve had numerous home sellers already take advantage of it. **There are four reasons, specifically, why this program may be your best option.&nbsp;**

1\. You need a fast sale and don’t have time to wait for an offer.<br>2\. You don’t want to deal with the home showings and everything else that comes with the typical home sale process.<br>3\. Time is more important to you than getting top dollar.&nbsp;<br>4\. You have equity in your house and need to sell now.

If you’re an investor, you need to call my team and me now, because we know how hard it is to find the right properties and compete against other investors to purchase them. As one of our investors, we’ll let you know which houses we have that fit your criteria. It’s an easy purchasing process, and you get to pick the closing date.&nbsp;

This is just one more way the Amy Wengerd Group is making it easy for sellers and investors to achieve success in any market. If you have any questions about this program or have any other real estate needs we can help you with, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.
