Homebuyers often ask if it’s worth it to spend the money to hire a professional home inspector. As it turns out, there are three key reasons why you should engage the services of an experienced inspector before you buy a home:

**1\. You’ll gain a better understanding of your new home.** Not only does a home inspector point out issues of concern, but they also answer any and all questions you might have about the systems in the house. Every house is different, so making sure that you have a good understanding of your new home is important.

<br>**2\. They’ll find both current and future issues with the home.** A home inspector won’t just find issues that currently beset the property, but they can also tell you which issues are most likely to arise in the future. It’s a really good idea to start a plan for home improvements in the future if you don’t want to be blindsided by costly repairs down the road.

<br>**3\. Home inspections will allow us to negotiate home repairs with the seller.** A great inspector will provide you with a thorough report, complete with pictures and details, within 24 hours of your inspection. Without that report, it’s virtually impossible for us to address any repair issues with the homeowner.
